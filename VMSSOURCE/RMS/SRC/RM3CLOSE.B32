! FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
!
!	If this is the last accessor of the file, deallocate all of the index
!	descriptors ( off the IFAB) and zero the pointer.
!
! CALLING SEQUENCE:
!	BSBW	RM$CLOSE3
!	entered via branch from RMS$CLOSE and will RSB back to CLSDLT
!
! INPUT PARAMETERS:
!	NONE
!
! IMPLICIT INPUTS:
!	R10 -- IFAB address

!
! OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
!	NONE
!
! IMPLICIT OUTPUTS:
!	NONE
!
! ROUTINE VALUE:
!	usual RMS status codes, especially SUC
!
! SIDE EFFECTS:
!	if they existed, the index descriptors will be deallocated
