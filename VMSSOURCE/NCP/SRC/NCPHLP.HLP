1 HELP

The  Network  Control Program (NCP) is a DECnet-VAX utility program
that accepts  terminal  commands  to  configure,  control, monitor,
and test a DECnet-VAX network.

Use  the  HELP  command  to  display  on the current  default output
stream  device  (SYS$OUTPUT)  information  available in the NCP help
file.

 Format:

      HELP    [keyword ...]
2 Parameters
 keyword ...

  Specifies one or more keywords that indicate what information you
  want.  Information is located in a hierarchical manner, depending
  on the level of information required.

  If you specify an asterisk (*) in place of any keyword, the  HELP
  command displays all information available at that level.

  If you specify an ellipsis (...) after any  keyword,  you  obtain
  everything in the help file at that level.

  You can specify percent signs (%) and asterisks (*) in the keyword
  as wild card characters.

!

1 EXIT

To exit NCP, enter EXIT or CTRL/Z after the NCP> prompt.

1 Prompting

NCP prompts for required components and parameters if they are not
supplied when you issue the command. Each prompt is either a list of
admissible keywords for that position in the command syntax or the
name of a parameter and a description of the value required.

Prompting will not occur when NCP receives input from a command file.
Parameter keywords must be supplied in command files.

Each prompt consists of two parts: the component or parameter desired,
and its format. The format of prompts is as follows:

        Component (Format):

2 Format_of_prompts

The component part indicates the name of either the component or
parameter. The format part indicates the range of acceptable values.
The format part presents keywords in uppercase, value classes in
lowercase as descriptive strings, and numeric ranges as two numbers
separated by a hyphen. Commas indicate alternatives which are mutually
exclusive.

2 Exiting_the_Prompting_Sequence

You can exit a prompting sequence by responding with CTRL/Z for the
prompt. This returns you to the NCP> prompt where you can then issue
another NCP command. You can exit NCP directly from the prompting
sequence by responding with CTRL/C or CTRL/Y.

Responding to a parameter prompt or query with "_DONE" skips the
remainder of the prompts or queries and performs the requested
function with the parameters which have been entered up to that point.

2 Examples

The following examples illustrate three types of  prompting  that  NCP
provides.

Prompts to supply missing command component keywords:

        NCP>CLEAR <RET>
        (LINE, CIRCUIT, LOGGING, KNOWN, NODE, OBJECT):

No component is specified for the CLEAR command.  The prompt format is
a  list  of  admissible  component keywords separated by commas.  Note
that the plural keyword KNOWN is included in this list.

Prompts to supply parameter values:

        NCP>CLEAR LINE <RET>
        LINE ID (dev-c-u.t):

NCP prompts for the  line-id  for  this  component  since  it  is  not
provided with the command.

The following example shows variations of  the  prompting  scheme  for
parameter values:

        NCP>SET EXECUTOR <RET>
        Node address           (1.1-63.1023): 2.11
        State    (ON, OFF, SHUT, RESTRICTED): ON
        ...
        Pipeline quota       (0-65535 bytes):6000  

Prompts to select parameter names:

        NCP>CLEAR LINE <RET>
        Line ID       (dev-c-u.t): DMC-1
        All line parameters (Y,N):

NCP prompts for the selected parameter names whose values  are  to  be
removed  from  the  database.   In  this case, no parameter name was
given;  consequently, NCP asks if all values  should  be  removed.   Y
indicates  that all values should be removed.  N causes NCP to provide
a different response.  For example,

        NCP>CLEAR NODE BOSTON <RET>
        All node parameters (Y,N): N
        Host node           (Y,N): Y
        Identification      (Y,N): N
        ...
        Service password    (Y,N): Y
        Tertiary loader     (Y,N): N

Since N is the response to the first prompt above, NCP prompts for all
of the parameter names.

!

1 Commands

The command  syntax  has four parts:   a command  keyword, a component
keyword(s), one  or  more  parameters, and, optionally,  one  or more   
qualifiers.  The command keywords are:

SET             Change parameters in the volatile database.
DEFINE          Change parameters in the permanent database.
CLEAR           Remove components or parameters from the
PURGE             volatile or permanent databases.
SHOW            Display information about components in the
LIST              volatile or permanent databases.
CONNECT         Connect local terminal to remote node console interface.
DISCONNECT      Disconnect logical links with processes.
LOOP            Test lines or connections to nodes.
LOAD            Downline load nodes.
TRIGGER         Initiate bootstrap sequence of a node.
TELL            Establish temporary executor node.
ZERO		Zero counters for the specified entity.

2 Syntax

The command syntax has four parts:  a command  keyword, a component
keyword(s),  one  or  more  parameters, and, optionally, one  or  more  
qualifiers.   For example,

     Command Keyword    Component        Parameter        Qualifier 

        SHOW            ACTIVE CIRCUITS  CHARACTERISTICS  TO file-id
                        KNOWN CIRCUITS   COUNTERS
                        CIRCUIT line-id  STATUS
                                         SUMMARY

For each command, you must supply a keyword, a component, and one
or more  parameters  from  the  parameter list.  In general, the
order in which you specify  parameters  makes  no  difference.
Braces  around keywords  and  parameters  indicate  that  you  must
choose one of the options.   Lowercase  letters  indicate
user-supplied  component  and parameter values.

2 Issuing_commands

You enter NCP commands as keywords and parameters separated by spaces
or tabs. Use the standard continuation line convention--a hyphen as
the last character in the line--to continue a long command to the next
line. If the first character of a line is an exclamation point (!),
the line is ignored by NCP as a comment line. Hyphens within and at
the end of a comment line are ignored. Lines beginning with an
exclamation point, however, are not ignored if they follow a command
line ending with a hyphen.

When entering an NCP command, you can abbreviate any command verb,
component keyword, or parameter name to its fewest unique letters.

1 PARAMETERS

Many parameters and components require user-supplied information when
you issue an NCP command. For the most part, their syntax follows a
standard set of rules. Exceptions to these rules are documented in the
description of the parameter for which they apply. For the list below,
all numeric values are in decimal and have a range of 0 to 65535 unless
otherwise specified.

Strings containing spaces and/or tabs are enclosed in double quotes
(").

2 account
a string of up to 39 printable characters. Can be a quoted
string.  The total length of user-id, password, and account
must be less than or equal to 39 characters.

2 area_number

2 event_list
a list of event types for a given class. When specifying an
event list, you may only specify one class; however, you
can specify a range of types by using commas and hyphens.
For example,  4.3-5,7-10.

See HELP EVENTS for a list of valid events.

2 circuit_id
a string in the form dev-c-u.t where the exact syntax is
not enforced by NCP, but passed intact to NML. For example:

response.  Count must be a decimal integer in the range 0 to 255.
The default count is 8. 

3 LISTEN TIMER
Specifies the maximum time allowed to elapse before Transport
receives a Hello message or a user message from the adjacent node
on the circuit.  If a message is not received in the specified
time, the circuit is assumed to have failed. Seconds must be a
decimal integer in the range 1 to 65535.  This value must be
greater than the value for the HELLO TIMER. 

3 MAXIMUM BUFFERS

number of buffers from a common buffer pool that the tributary
can use.  If you do not set this parameter, there is no common
buffer pool and the higher level will explicitly supply the
buffers.  Count must be a decimal integer in the range 1 to 254
or the keyword, UNLIMITED. 

3 MAXIMUM DATA count 
Applies only to X.25 circuits.  Specifies the maximum packetsize for

testing) are allowed for the circuit.  There are two possible
modes: 

    DISABLED	The circuit may not be put into
		service state and may not
		perform service functions.

    ENABLED	The circuit may be put into
		service state and perform
		service functions.

3 STATE
Specifies the circuit's operational state. There are three
possible states:

                    outgoing calls. 

    PERMANENT       This  parameter  is  mandatory  
                    for X.25 PVCs.  The circuit is
                    permanently connected to a remote
                    DTE, and does not need to be 
                    switched dynamically. 


3 VERIFICATION
Requests the remote node to send NSP verification messages. 
There are two options: 

    DISABLED	does not allow the remote node to send NSP 
		verification messages.  This is the default.

    ENABLED	requests the remote node to send NSP verification messages.

3 Examples

    area-number.node-number

where the area-number is in the range 1 to 63 and the node number
is in the range 1 to 1023.  If the area-number is not specified,
a default value of 1 is assumed.  You need not supply the area
number in the node-address if your node is in area 1.  This parameter
is required when you configure the local node.

3 AREA MAXIMUM COST 
Applies only to an executor node whose type is AREA.  Specifies
the maximum total path cost allowed from the executor to any
other level 2 routing node.  You can specify a decimal value in
the range 1 to 1022.  The default value is 1022.

maximum segment size, including the transport header, of all NSP
messages received. 

3 COUNTER TIMER 
Specifies a timer whose expiration causes a line counter logging
event. 

3 DEFAULT ACCESS
Assigns the default access to all nodes which do not have a
specific node ACCESS entry in the volatile data base.  There are
four options: 
 
   INCOMING     Allows logical link connections from the remote node. 

   OUTGOING     Allows the local node to initiate connections to the
                remote node; but does not allow connections from the 
                remote node.

   BOTH         Allows incoming and outgoing logical link connections.
                This is the default.

                connections to this node.

3 DEFAULT PROXY 
Assigns the default proxy to the executor node.  There are four options:

   INCOMING     Allows proxy login access from the remote node to the
                local node.

   OUTGOING     Allows the local node to initiate proxy login access to
                the remote node, but does not allow proxy login access
                from the remote node to the local node.

   BOTH         Allows both incoming and outgoing proxy login access.
                This is the default and the recommended default proxy
                option.

   NONE         Does not allow incoming or outgoing proxy login access
                connections to this node.
         
3 DELAY FACTOR
Specifies the number by which to multiply one sixteenth of the
estimated round trip delay to a node to set the retransmission
timer to that node.  Use a number in the range 1 to 255.  The  
default value is 80.

3 DELAY WEIGHT
Specifies the weight to apply to a new round trip delay data
point when updating the estimated round trip delay to a node. 
Use a number in the range of 1 to 255.  The default value is 5.

3 IDENTIFICATION
Is  a  text  string  that  describes the executor node (that is,
"Host System").  The string can be a maximum of 32 characters. 
If it contains blanks or tabs, you must enclose the string in
quotation marks. 

3 INACTIVITY TIMER
Specifies  the  maximum duration of inactivity (no data in either
direction) on a logical link before the node checks to see if the
logical link still works. If you do not set this parameter,
NETACP will supply a default value.  It is recommended that you
allow NETACP to supply the default. 

3 INCOMING TIMER
Defines  the  maximum  duration  between the time a connection is
received for a process and the time that process accepts or
rejects the connection.  For very busy systems, use a value in
the range of 45 to 60 seconds.  Otherwise use a value of 30
seconds. 

3 MAXIMUM ADDRESS
Defines   the   largest   node  address and, consequently, the
greatest number of nodes that can be addressed by the local node.
Use as small a number as possible. If you receive an "INVALID
VALUE" error, you probably have not allocated enough nonpaged 
pool space.  You must lower the MAXIMUM ADDRESS value or increase
the VAX/VMS NPAGEDYN value.  See Chapter 5 of the Guide to Networking
on VAX/VMS for some guidelines on NPAGEDYN. 

3 MAXIMUM AREA
Applies only to an executor node whose type is AREA.  Specifies
the largest area number and, therefore, the greatest number of
areas that can be known about by the executor node's Routing layer.
You can specify a decimal value in the range 1 to 63.  The default
is 63.

3 MAXIMUM BUFFERS
Specifies   the   total   number   of  buffers in the transmit
buffer pool.  The value must be larger than that for the MAXIMUM
CIRCUITS parameter.  Use a value that is 15 times the square root
of the number of lines.  Increase this value if you experience
congestion loss. 

3 MAXIMUM CIRCUITS
Defines  the  maximum  number  of  transport circuits that the
local node can use.  Number must be in the range 1 to 32. If you
receive an "INVALID VALUE" error, you probably have not allocated
enough Non Paged Pool space.  You must lower the MAXIMUM CIRCUITS
value or increase the VAX/VMS NPAGEDYN value.  See Chapter 5 of the
Guide to Networking on VAX/VMS  for some guidelines on NPAGEDYN. 

3 MAXIMUM COST
Specifies the maximum total path cost allowed from the local node
to any node.  The path cost is the sum of the line costs along a
path between two nodes.  Use as small a number as possible in the
range of 1 to 1023. 

3 MAXIMUM HOPS
Specifies the maximum routing hops from the local node to any
other reachable node. A hop is the logical distance over a line
between two adjacent nodes.  Use as small a number as possible in
the range of 1 to 31, and be sure that this value is less than or
equal to the MAXIMUM VISITS parameter. If you receive an "INVALID
VALUE" error, you probably have not allocated enough Non Paged
Pool space.  You must lower the MAXIMUM HOPS value or increase
the VAX/VMS NPAGEDYN value.  Refer to Chapter 5 of the Guide to  
Networking on VAX/VMS for some guidelines on NPAGEDYN. 

3 MAXIMUM LINKS
Specifies the maximum logical link count for the local node.  A
reasonable range for most networks is 25 to 50. 

3 MAXIMUM VISITS
Specifies the maximum number of nodes a message can visit prior
to being received by the destination node.  Use a number in the
range of 1 to 255.  The value must be greater than or equal to
the value for the MAXIMUM HOPS parameter.  It is suggested that
you specify a number that is twice the MAXIMUM HOPS value. 

3 OUTGOING TIMER
Specifies a time out value  for  the  duration between the time a
connection is requested and the time that connection is
acknowledged by the destination node.  It is recommended that you
use a value in the range of 30 to 60 seconds. 

3 PIPELINE QUOTA
Specifies the number of bytes that NSP will take from the process
byte count quota when the logical link connection is made.  Use
this parameter for multibuffering at the NSP level. 

3 RETRANSMIT FACTOR
Defines  the  maximum  number  of  times any given message
(except a connect initiate message) will be retransmitted before
the logical link is disconnected.  If you do not set this
parameter, NETACP will supply a default value.  It is recommended
that you allow NETACP to supply the default. 

3 ROUTING TIMER
Specifies the maximum duration before a routing update is forced.
The routing update produces a routing configuration message for
each adjacent node.  You can use a number in the range of 1 to 65535.
If you don't set this parameter, NETACP will supply a default
value.  It is recommended that you allow NETACP to supply the
default. 

3 STATE
Specifies the operational state of the local node.  There are
four possible states: 

    OFF		Allows no new logical links,
		terminates existing links,
		and stops route-through
		traffic

    ON		Allows logical links

    RESTRICTED	Allows no new inbound links
		from other nodes

    SHUT	Allows no new logical links,
		does not destroy existing
		links, and goes to the OFF
		state when all logical links
		are gone

3 SUBADDRESS range 
Applies only to VAX-11 PSI.  Specifies a range of local DTE
subaddresses that the Routing Layer will accept as X.25 DLM calls. 
VAX-11 PSI will route all incoming X.25 calls within the specified
subaddress range to the Routing Layer to be handled as DLM calls. 

3 TYPE 
Indicates the type of the executor node.  Possible node types are

                   ROUTING IV
                   NONROUTING IV
                   AREA

The default depends upon the DECnet-VAX license installed.  If the
full function kit is installed, the default is ROUTING IV; if the end
node kit is installed, the default (and only possible value) is
NONROUTING IV.

A routing node has full routing capability.  A nonrouting node (or end
node) can deliver packets to or receive them from any node, but
cannot route packets from other source nodes through to destination
nodes.

An area node is a level 2 router that can route packets between areas.

Management Listener (NML) runs to perform these  commands.

Note that the NODE keyword must  appear  as  the  third  keyword  when
entering  the  command.   The  remaining information may appear in any
order thereafter, except the node-spec  which  must  follow  the  NODE
keyword.  Access control information is optional.

SET     EXECUTOR        NODE node-spec          ACCOUNT account
                                                PASSWORD password

    followed by access control information as
    specified for VAX/VMS.  Use one of the
    following formats:

    node-id
    node-id"user password account"

4 PASSWORD password
    identifies the user's password for access
    control verification at the designated
    executor node.

4 USER user-id
    identifies the user's ID for access control
    verification at the designated executor node.

4 Examples

     NCP>SET EXECUTOR NODE 14
      ...

     NCP>CLEAR EXECUTOR NODE

         The first command sets the executor to node 1.14.  (The default
         area number 1 is assumed if the area number is not specified in
         the node address.)  The  second command resets the executor to 
         the executor node.

     NCP>SET EXECUTOR NODE 14"LOW JBL"

         This command uses  access  control  information  to  set  the
         executor node to node 1.14.

     NCP>SET EXECUTOR NODE TRNTO USER LOW PASSWORD JBL

         This command uses an alternate access control format  to  set
         the executor to node TRNTO.

			from outside the device.  Note that in
			order to use this parameter, the operator
			may have to connect a loopback plug in
			place of the normal line.

	EXTERNAL	For normal clock operating mode.  The

                        (default).

        NODE node-id    identifies a node in the
                        network.

3 STATE
specifies the operational state of the sink. There are three possible
states:

        HOLD    The sink is temporarily unavailable
                and events should be queued.

        OFF     The sink is unavailable for receiving
                events.

        ON      The sink is available for receiving
                events.

3 Examples


     NCP>SET LOGGING MONITOR KNOWN EVENTS
     NCP>SET LOGGING MONITOR STATE ON

         These two commands enable normal event logging using OPCOM.
         To receive the formatted events at a terminal, use the DCL
         command, REPLY/ENABLE=NETWORK.

     NCP>SET LOGGING CONSOLE KNOWN EVENTS
     NCP>SET LOGGING CONSOLE NAME [SYSMGR]EVENTS.DAT
     NCP>CLEAR LOGGING CONSOLE EVENT 4.14
     NCP>SET LOGGING CONSOLE STATE ON

          These commands enable formatted logging of all events but 
          the node reachability change event to file EVENTS.DAT.

     NCP>SET LOGGING MONITOR STATE OFF

         This command sets the operational state  of  logging  to
         OPCOM on the executor node to OFF.

         This command sets the executor to node 3.5 where the SET  KNOWN
         LINES ALL command executes.

     NCP>TELL TRNTO"LOW JBL"  SHOW KNOWN LINES

         This command uses  access  control  information  to  set  the
         executor  to  node  TRNTO  where the SHOW KNOWN LINES command
         executes.

     NCP>TELL TRNTO USER SYSTEM PASSWORD MANAGER ZERO EXECUTOR

         This command uses an alternate access control format  to  set
         the  executor  to  node TRNTO where the ZERO EXECUTOR command
         executes.

1 TRIGGER

Use the TRIGGER commands to trigger the bootstrap mechanism  of  a
target  node such that the node will load itself.  Use this command to
initiate the loading sequence for  an  unattended  system.

2 NODE

Use the TRIGGER NODE command to trigger the bootstrap mechanism  of  a
target  node such that the node will load itself.  Use this command to
initiate the loading sequence for  an  unattended  system.

TRIGGER NODE node-id    SERVICE PASSWORD hex-password   VIA circuit-id


3 NODE node-id
identifies the node whose bootstrap is to be triggered.

3 SERVICE PASSWORD hex-password
identifies the password required to trigger the bootstrap
mechanism on the target node.

3 VIA circuit-id
identifies the circuit over which the operation is to take
place.
