! Symbols are defined following the standard for global names:
!
!	SMG$_abcmnoxyz
!
! In addition, the library standards specify that the letters "abc", "mno",
! and "xyz" are the first three letters of the first three words of the error
! message, not counting articles and prepositions.
!
! The names of all procedures using each error condition value should appear
! in the comments included with each error definition.

! Each explanation follows the message it applies to and
! is followed by a blank line.
! Be sure not to use the sequence "++" after a "!" in regular comments
! as this sequence begins a documentation sequence and can be
! searched for if and when the process of extracting the
! documentation becomes automated.

	!++
	! FACILITY:	SMG
	! EXPLANATION:	x
	! USER ACTION:	y
	!--

!			; Set LH to 18 (decimal).
	.FACILITY	SMG,18 /SYSTEM
	.SEVERITY	SUCCESS

	.BASE		0

	NORMAL		<normal successful completion>
	!++
	! FACILITY:	SMG
	! EXPLANATION:	Normal successful completion.
	! USER ACTION:	none
	!--

	.BASE		2

	PREDEFREP	<previous key-definition replaced>
	!++
	! FACILITY:	SMG
	! EXPLANATION:	A previous key definition was replaced by a new
	!		definition.
	! USER ACTION:	none
	!--

	!+
	! The next three messages are used by the "batching"
	! procedures, SMG$BEGIN_DISPLAY_UPDATE and SMG$END_DISPLAY_UPDATE.
	! The text of the messages should change if we decide not
	! to publicly use the term "batching".
	!-

	BATSTIPRO	<batching is still in progress>
	!++
	! FACILITY:	SMG
	! EXPLANATION:	A user tried to end batching (updating) with
	!		a call to SMG$END_DISPLAY_UPDATE or
	!		SMG$END_PASTEBOARD_UPDATE.  This did not
	!		terminate batching because there were more calls
	!		made to begin batching than to end batching.
	! USER ACTION:	None.  Some outer level routine probably still
	!		wants batching to be in effect.
	!--

	BATWASOFF	<batching was off>
	!++
	! FACILITY:	SMG
	! EXPLANATION:	A program tried to turn off batching when
	!		batching was already off.
	! USER ACTION:	Probably none.  Check that there was one call
	!		to turn on batching for each call to turn it off.
	!--

	BATWAS_ON	<batching was on>
	!++
	! FACILITY:	SMG
	! EXPLANATION:	A program tried to turn on batching when
	!		batching was already on.  This is normal in
	!		a modular environment.
	! USER ACTION:	None.  Check that there was one call
	!		to turn on batching for each call to turn it off.
	!--

	PASALREXI	<pasteboard already exists for this device>
	!++
	! FACILITY:	SMG
	! EXPLANATION:	A user tried to create a pasteboard for a device,
	!		when one was already created.  This is normal in
	!		a modular environment.  The existing pasteboard id
	!		is returned.
	! USER ACTION:	None. Make sure you don't delete a pasteboard
	!		that you actually didn't create.
	!--

	NOT_A_TRM	<pasteboard attached to a device that is not a terminal>
	!++
	! FACILITY:	SMG
	! EXPLANATION:	This is an informational message telling you that
	!		the pasteboard has been created, but the output
	!		device is not a terminal.
	! USER ACTION:	None.
	!--

	NO_MORMSG	<no more broadcast messages are available>
	!++
	! FACILITY:	SMG
	! EXPLANATION:	A call to SMG$GET_BROADCAST_MESSAGE found that
	!		there were no more messages to be obtained.
	! USER ACTION:	None.
	!--

	WILUSERMS	<output will be performed by RMS later>
	!++
	! FACILITY:	SMG
	! EXPLANATION:	Normally the screen is updated at the end of
	!		every output operation.  If, however, the 'device'
	!		is actually a file or an unknown terminal, then
	!		this message is given at the time output would
	!		have been sent to the screen.
	! USER ACTION:	none
	!--

	NOTRMSOUT	<RMS is not being used to perform output>
	!++
	! FACILITY:	SMG
	! EXPLANATION:	SMG$SNAPSHOT is used with files and unknown devices
	!		to capture the contents of the pasteboard at various
	!		times.  If SMG$SNAPSHOT is called for a pasteboard
	!		associated with a video terminal, then it takes no
	!		action and returns this informational message.
	! USER ACTION:	none
	!--

	NO_CHADIS	<no change in virtual display>
	!++
	! FACILITY:	SMG
	! EXPLANATION:	The requested number of columns to change was zero,
	!		so nothing in the virtual display was changed.
	! USER ACTION:	none
	!--

	PRISECMAP	<private terminal table used>
	!++
	! FACILITY:	SMG
	! EXPLANATION:	The requested terminal definition was found in
	!		the caller's private copy of Termtable.

	!		This includes displays on all pasteboards.
	! USER ACTION:	Use fewer virtual displays.
	!		Make sure that your program is not in a loop
	!		creating virtual displays.  Be sure that you delete
	!		a virtual display when you are all done with it.
	!--

	TOOMANPAS	<too many pasteboards>
	!++
	! FACILITY:	SMG
	! EXPLANATION:	An internal limit on the number of pasteboards
	!		that your program may have has been exceeded.
