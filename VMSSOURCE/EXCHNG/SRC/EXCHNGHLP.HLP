1 An_Overview
                    EXCHANGE UTILITY (EXCHANGE)

 The Exchange Utility (EXCHANGE) is a utility program that is used
 with  mass-storage  volumes  that  are  formatted  for  operating
 systems other than VAX/VMS.  EXCHANGE can transfer files  between
 these  foreign  volumes  and  VAX/VMS native volumes, it can also
 perform volume-specific initialization and manipulation functions
 on  the foreign volumes.  It converts the format of the files, as
 appropriate,  when  transferring  files  between   volumes   with
 different structures.

 EXCHANGE performs file transfers and format conversions on:

       o  DOS-11 magnetic tape volumes
       o  Files-11 volumes
       o  RT-11 block-addressable volumes

 In addition to transferring files, EXCHANGE allows you to:

       o  Initialize foreign volumes
       o  List directories of volumes
       o  Delete files from block-addressable volumes
       o  Rename files on block-addressable volumes
       o  Write boot blocks on RT-11 volumes
       o  Mount and dismount foreign volumes

 EXCHANGE recognizes all Files-11 volumes on VAX/VMS devices.   It
 recognizes  DOS-11  formatted  volumes  on  9-track magnetic tape
 devices.

 EXCHANGE  recognizes  RT-11  volumes  on   any   VAX/VMS   block-
 addressable  device.   Note, however, that of the VAX/VMS devices
 RT-11 only supports the following devices:

      o  TU58 DECtape II data cartridge
      o  RL01 or RL02 cartridge disk
      o  RK06 or RK07 cartridge disk
      o  RX01 or RX02 floppy disk

 Also note that RT-11 imposes a size limit of 65535 blocks for the
 volume.  If an RT-11 volume is created on a device that is larger
 than this, the size of the  RT-11  volume  will  be  set  to  the
 maximum  and  blocks  65536  to  the  end of the volume cannot be
 utilized.

 EXCHANGE also supports a "volume" which is contained in a  VAX-11
 RMS  file  on  a  VAX/VMS  disk.  These files are termed virtual-
 devices.  The virtual-device file may be  manipulated  as  if  it
 were a block-addressable device.

 Files-11 Structure Level 1 or Files-11 Structure Level 2  volumes
 are  the  default  for  disk  volumes  initialized by the DIGITAL
 Command Language (DCL)  command  INITIALIZE.   DOS-11  and  RT-11
 volumes  are  initialized  using the EXCHANGE INITIALIZE command.
 Since the formats of these volumes are not recognized by VAX/VMS,
 the  volumes  must be mounted foreign, that is, by use of the DCL
 MOUNT command with the /FOREIGN or /NOLABEL qualifiers.  See  the
 VAX/VMS Command Language User's Guide for more information on the
 INITIALIZE and MOUNT commands.
1 Invoking
 You can use EXCHANGE interactively  or  as  a  DCL  command.   To
 invoke EXCHANGE interactively, enter the following in response to
 the DCL prompt:

      $ EXCHANGE

 The utility responds with the prompt:

      EXCHANGE>

 You can now enter any EXCHANGE command string.  To return to  DCL
 from the EXCHANGE> prompt, type EXIT or CTRL/Z.

 To use EXCHANGE as a DCL command, append the  command  string  to
 the EXCHANGE verb, as shown below.

      $ EXCHANGE DIRECTORY DMA1:/VOLUME_FORMAT=RT11

 This DCL mode command lists the directory  of  the  RT-11  volume
 mounted  on  DMA1:.   In  this  mode EXCHANGE executes the single
 command and returns to the  DCL  command  level.   Some  EXCHANGE
 features,  such  as  use  of  virtual-devices, require the use of
 multiple EXCHANGE commands.  Since EXCHANGE can  only  process  a
 single  command  in  DCL  command  mode, features which require a
 sequence of EXCHANGE commands are not available  in  DCL  command
 mode.
2 Qualifiers
 EXCHANGE allows two  qualifiers  on  the  EXCHANGE  verb  itself.
 These  qualifiers  must  be placed immediately after the EXCHANGE
 verb, they cannot be placed on the EXCHANGE command string.   The
 verb qualifiers are used to define conditions which are to remain
 in effect for the entire EXCHANGE session.

/CACHE

 /CACHE      (default)
 /NOCACHE

      Normally (i.e.  with the  default  /NOCACHE)  EXCHANGE  will
      attempt  to  reduce  the  number of I/O operations which are
      required to complete a command.  This  is  done  by  keeping
      certain  information,  such  as  the  volume  directory,  in
      memory.  At the completion of each  command,  EXCHANGE  will
      write  this  information  back  to  the  device.  The /CACHE
      option tells EXCHANGE to keep  this  information  in  memory
      until  EXCHANGE exits or the volume is dismounted.  This can
      result in improved performance on slower devices, especially
      the TU58 data cartridge.
/MESSAGE

 /MESSAGE      (default)
 /NOMESSAGE

      In the usual case (i.e.  with /MESSAGE in effect),  EXCHANGE
      will  print  a  status message when a volume is initialized,
      when a volume is mounted, and when a volume  is  dismounted.
      If  the  /NOMESSAGE  qualifier  is  used,  the  default  for
      EXCHANGE is to not print any messages  for  these  commands.
      This is most useful to keep unwanted messages from appearing
      when EXCHANGE is used in a command procedure.   For  further
      information,  see the description of the /MESSAGE qualifiers
      on the EXCHANGE INITIALIZE, MOUNT and DISMOUNT verbs.
1 Command_Formats
 Most EXCHANGE command strings are very similar to the  analoguous
 DCL  command  for  native  volumes.   The  general  form  for the
 EXCHANGE command string is:
      
   verb/qualifier  file-spec/qualifier[,...]  [file-spec/qualifier]

 The second file-spec is only needed  for  commands  that  specify
 data transfers or require additional parameters.

2 Verb

      The verb defines the action to  be  performed  by  EXCHANGE.
      The verb is the same as the DCL command verb that performs a
      similar function on native volumes.  If no corresponding DCL
      command  exists,  the  verb is taken from the command on the
      foreign operating system.  Valid verbs are:

           COPY        Copy files from input to output spec
           DELETE      Delete files from block-addressable volumes
           DIRECTORY   List names of files on volume
           DISMOUNT    Dismount a volume
           EXIT        Return to the DCL command level
           HELP        Obtain help on EXCHANGE commands
           INITIALIZE  Create an empty volume
           MOUNT       Mount a volume on a device (foreign only)
           RENAME      Rename files on block-addressable volumes
           SHOW        Show volumes known to EXCHANGE
           TYPE        Display files on the default output device

      Since each of the verbs requires a particular command format
      and  set  of  qualifiers,  each  will  be  described  in  an
      individual section later in this document.  The  format  and
      applicable   qualifiers  will  be  described  in  the  later
      section.

2 /qualifier

      Any of the qualifiers allowed for the particular verb.   Multiple
      qualifiers can be used.  Some qualifiers affect the action of the
      command, others affect only the file-spec they follow.

2 File-spec

      The device name, directory, and/or file  name  for  the  EXCHANGE
      input or output device.  It has the general form:

           device:<directory>filename.filetype;version

      The following subfield definitions apply:

3 device:

           The device name can be either a standard VAX/VMS device name
           of  the  form  ddcu:  or a logical name that translates to a
           VAX/VMS device name.  If the device field is omitted  for  a
           reference,  the  current  default device is assumed.  When a
           virtual-device  is  mounted,  a  name  is  created  for  the
           virtual-device   which   is  used  as  the  device  name  in
           subsequent EXCHANGE commands.

3 <directory>

           The directory on the volume which contains  the  file.   The
           syntax of the directory subfield is volume-specific.

3 filename

           The name field file specification for  an  input  or  output
           file.    The  exact  format  allowed  for  the  filename  is
           dependent on the volume format qualifier used.

3 .filetype

           The extension field of the file specification.

3 ;version

           The version number of the file, if supported by  the  volume
           type.
1 Volume_Formats
 EXCHANGE  uses  the  /VOLUME_FORMAT=option  qualifier  to  define  the
 physical format of volumes to be processed.  A volume format qualifier
 determines what operations are allowed on the volume, and  will  often
 imply certain defaults.  A volume format qualifier also determines the
 format of the file name and directory specifications.

               Table 6-1:  EXCHANGE Volume Format Options

      Option                            Function

      FILES11        Identifies a Files-11 formatted native volume
      RT11           Identifies an  RT-11  formatted  block-addressable
                     volume
      DOS11          Identifies a DOS-11 formatted magnetic tape volume

 Volume format qualifiers must be attached to one or both of  the  file
 specification  parameters,  they  cannot  be  attached directly to the
 verb.

 Multiple volumes of different  volume  types  can  be  specified,  for
 example:

      EXCHANGE>  COPY  DMA1:*.FOR/VOLUME=RT11,MTA0:<11,132>*.FOR/VOLUME=DOS11  *
2 FILES11_Volumes

 Files-11 is the standard volume format  maintained  by  VAX/VMS.   The
 mass-storage  formats  fully  supported  by  VAX/VMS are ANSI magnetic
 tapes and Files-11 disk structure  levels  1  and  2.   EXCHANGE  uses
 VAX-11 RMS for operations on these file structures.

3 Device_Specs

 Files-11  volumes  accept  the  standard  form   of   VAX/VMS   device
 specification  as  documented  in  the VAX/VMS Command Language User's
 Guide.  Files-11 disk volumes must be  mounted  without  the  /FOREIGN
 qualifier.

 The FILES11 option is  used  when  referencing  any  standard  VAX/VMS
 device,  even  though  the  Files-11  structure specifically refers to
 directory-structured devices such as disks, diskettes,  and  DECtapes.
 This  is  consistent with VAX-11 RMS, which allows unit-record devices
 (such as terminals) and magnetic tapes to be  accessed  in  a  device-
 independent fashion.

 If FILES11 is used when referencing a magnetic tape  device,  an  ANSI
 formatted  magnetic  tape  device will be implied.  The tape must have
 been mounted as an ANSI volume.  See the VAX/VMS Magnetic Tape  User's
 Guide  for  additional  information  on  the use of ANSI magnetic tape
 volumes.
3 File_Specs

 Files-11  volumes  accept  the   standard   form   of   VAX/VMS   file
 specification documented in the VAX/VMS Command Language User's Guide.
 EXCHANGE allows unrestricted use of logical  names  in  Files-11  file
 specifications.   If  device  or  directory specifications are omitted
 from Files-11 specifications, the current  process  defaults  will  be
 used.

 Wild card  characters  are  valid  for  both  input  and  output  file
 specifications.  Version numbers should not be specified as wild cards
 when the foreign volume does not support version numbers, such as  for
 RT-11 and DOS-11.

 EXCHANGE permits output file specifications.  Any wild card fields  in
 the  output  file  specification  take the corresponding name from the
 input files.
2 RT11_Volumes

 The RT11 option is used to read and write block-addressable volumes in
 the  format  used  by DIGITAL's RT-11 operating system.  EXCHANGE does
 not restrict one to using  devices  that  are  actually  supported  by
 RT-11.
3 Device_Specs

 The device name for the RT-11 volume can be either a standard  VAX/VMS
 device name of the form ddcu:  or a logical name which translates to a
 VAX/VMS device name.  This device must have been mounted foreign,  for
 example   by  using  the  VAX/VMS  MOUNT  command  with  the  /FOREIGN
 qualifier.
3 File_Specs

 RT-11 volumes do not have user directories, therefore the  RT-11  file
 specification has no directory field.

 The RT-11 character set for file names is the capital letters A-Z  and
 the  digits 0-9.  (These are RADIX-50 characters.) The file name field
 for RT-11 is six characters, the file type field is three characters.

 When a file with a name which is not valid under RT-11 is copied to an
 RT-11 volume, the RT-11 file name is produced from the first six valid
 characters of the name.  The RT-11 file type is  extracted  the  first
 three  valid  characters  of the input file type (for input names that
 are similar to Files-11 names).  Lowercase letters will  be  converted
 to uppercase before the check for a valid file name.  For example:

      EXCHANGE>  COPY/LOG  SYS_CREATE.MACRO_32  DMA0:
      %EXCHANGE-S-COPNEWNAME, DEVD$:<SYS.SRC>SYS_CREATE.MACRO_32;34
              copied to DMA0:SYSCRE.MAC (new name), 937 records

      EXCHANGE>  COPY/LOG  MTA0:"ANSI (A) TAPENAME"  DMA0:
      %EXCHANGE-S-COPNEWNAME, MTA0:<>"ANSI (A) TAPENAME".;1
              copied to DMA0:ANSIAT.  (new name), 321 records

 EXCHANGE permits renaming a file on a copy operation, so  any  desired
 file name can be supplied for the output file.
2 DOS11_Volumes

 The DOS11 option is used to specify that a magnetic  tape  is  in  the
 format  defined  by  DIGITAL's  early  PDP-11  Disk  Operating System,
 DOS-11.
3 Device_Specs

 The  DOS-11  format  is  supported  on  magnetic  tape  devices  only.
 Therefore,  a  VAX/VMS  device  specification for a 9-track tape drive
 must be present for DOS11 format.
3 File_Specs

 DOS-11 volumes only accept directories in the user identification code
 (UIC)  format,  for  example  <310,22>.  The two numbers are octal and
 must be in the range 0 through 377.  When the directory  is  specified
 in an input file specification, either number or both may be indicated
 by a wild card character.

 The EXCHANGE DIRECTORY command uses a default directory of  <*,*>,  so
 that all the files on the tape will be listed regardless of the DOS-11
 directory.  For all other commands EXCHANGE uses your current  default
 directory,  if it is in UIC format;  otherwise, it uses your process's
 UIC as a directory.  If a file that appears in an  EXCHANGE  DIRECTORY
 command  is not found by another EXCHANGE command, reenter the command
 and specify the same directory which was displayed for the file in the
 DIRECTORY command.

 The DOS-11 character set for file names is the same as for RT-11,  the
 capital letters A-Z and the digits 0-9.  The DOS-11 file name field is
 nine characters long;  the file type field is three characters. * When
 a  file  with  a  name  which is not valid under DOS-11 is copied to a
 DOS-11 tape, the file name on the tape comes from the first nine valid
 characters  of the input file name.  The DOS-11 file type is extracted
 from the first three valid characters of  the  input  file  type  (for
 input  names  that  are similar to Files-11 names).  Lowercase letters
 will be converted to uppercase before the check for a valid file name.
 _______________
 * The original DOS-11 file name was a six-character  field.   The  RSX
   and  VMS FLX Utility extended the six characters to nine, in several
   steps as FLX evolved.  DOS-11 systems and older versions  of  RSX-11
   might  not  support  nine character file names.  These older systems
   will only see the first six letters of the file name.

 For example:

      EXCHANGE>  COPY/LOG  SYS_CREATE.MACRO_32  MFA0:
      %EXCHANGE-S-COPNEWNAME, DEVD$:<SYS.SRC>SYS_CREATE.MACRO_32;34
              copied to MFA0:SYSCREATE.MAC (new name), 937 records

      EXCHANGE>  COPY/LOG  MTA0:"ANSI (A) TAPENAME"  MFA0:/VOLUME=DOS11
      %EXCHANGE-S-COPNEWNAME, MTA0:<>"ANSI (A) TAPENAME".;1
              copied to MFA0:ANSIATAPE.  (new name), 321 records
2 Volume_Defaults

 EXCHANGE will use default volume formats if an explicit /VOLUME_FORMAT
 qualifier  is  not  used.  The defaults are quite simple, yet powerful
 enough so that in practice it is almost  never  necessary  to  use  an
 explicit /VOLUME_FORMAT qualifier.

 EXCHANGE defaults to /VOLUME_FORMAT=FILES11 if a volume is mounted  as
 a  native volume, that is, mounted without /FOREIGN or /NOLABEL.  This
 applies to both block-addressable and magnetic tape devices.

 EXCHANGE defaults to /VOLUME_FORMAT=RT11 for block-addressable volumes
 (disks, diskettes, and TU-58 DECtapes) that are mounted foreign.

 EXCHANGE defaults to /VOLUME_FORMAT=DOS11 for  9-track  magnetic  tape
 volumes that are mounted foreign.

 Since EXCHANGE defaults to the current default device if no device  is
 given, entering a command sequence such as

      $ MOUNT/FOREIGN DMA0:
      $ SET DEFAULT DMA0:

 before invoking EXCHANGE will effectively cause EXCHANGE to default to
 the  RT-11  volume  DMA0:   for any file reference that omits a device
 specification.
1 Record_Formats
   RECORD_FORMAT, CARRIAGE_CONTROL and TRANSFER_MODE Qualifiers

 EXCHANGE uses the /RECORD_FORMAT=option qualifier to  define  the
 internal  record  structure  of  a  file on a foreign volume.  An
 additional option to /RECORD_FORMAT defines a  related  attribute
 of the records.  The carriage control attributes for the file are
 defined  with  the   /CARRIAGE_CONTROL=option   qualifier.    The
 /TRANSFER_MODE  qualifier  can  be  used to specify that the data
 should be copied without translation as records.

    EXCHANGE /RECORD_FORMAT Options

       Option                           Function
      ----------     ---------------------------------------------
      BINARY         Identifies  PDP-11  formatted  binary  record
                       format
      FIXED          Identifies fixed-length record format
      STREAM         Identifies ASCII stream record format

      Record Attribute
      -----------------
      PAD            Sets the character to pad  short  records  on
                     fixed-length output, valid only with FIXED

 The three record format options (BINARY, FIXED  and  STREAM)  are
 mutually  exclusive;  only one of these options may be specified.
 Certain combinations of volume and record  format  and  attribute
 options are also invalid.

 On an input  file  specification,  the  /RECORD_FORMAT  qualifier
 gives  EXCHANGE  additional information to be used in reading the
 file.  This is needed  when  a  foreign  file  structure  is  not
 completely  self-describing,  or when a special interpretation of
 the file structure is needed.

 Input record format qualifiers are  never  required  on  Files-11
 input,  since Files-11 stores file attributes that allow EXCHANGE
 to correctly read the file.  The only option of this  group  that
 is  valid  for Files-11 input is the /TRANSFER_MODE=BLOCK option.
 In the absence of  an  explicit  transer  mode  option,  however,
 Files-11  input  files will have an implied /RECORD_FORMAT option
 of BINARY, FIXED or STREAM based on the actual record  format  of
 the  file.   If  a Files-11 file is not in a suitable format, use
 the DCL command CONVERT to change the file to the desired format.
 CONVERT  is  described  in detail in the VAX-11 Record Management
 Services Utilities Reference Manual.

 On an output file specification, the /RECORD_FORMAT qualifier  is
 used  to  specify  the characteristics that an output file should
 have after it is copied.  For Files-11 output, EXCHANGE  supports
 the   VAX/VMS   File  Definition  Language  rather  than  various
 /RECORD_FORMAT options.  By using an FDL  file  to  describe  the
 output  file,  the  full  range  of VAX-11 RMS file attributes is
 available.  Specific options are available on the  /RECORD_FORMAT
 and   /CARRIAGE_CONTROL  qualifier  to  provide  commonly  needed
 attributes, so most copies can  be  made  without  using  an  FDL
 specification.   The File Definition Language is described in the
 VAX-11 Record Management Services Utilities Reference Manual.

 EXCHANGE  generates  Files-11  output   files   with   sequential
 organization  by  default.   The  default  Files-11 output record
 format is  Variable  if the  input  file  is  BINARY,  STREAM  or
 Variable  format, and FIXED if the input file has FIXED format or
 if /TRANSFER_MODE=BLOCK.  The default Files-11  carriage  control
 attribute is carriage-return.

 Three major record structure options exist.  These are:
2 BINARY


           BINARY record format is  valid  with  DOS-11  or  RT-11
           volumes.  BINARY files (also known as formatted binary)
           have variable-length records with headers and checksums
           added  to each record.  Formatted binary file format is
           described in  detail  in  the  RT-11  Software  Support
           Manual.   BINARY is not meaningful for Files-11 output,
           and will produce an error.

           On conversions from DOS-11 or  RT-11  BINARY  input  to
           Files-11  output,  EXCHANGE  generates  variable-length
           records.  The  output  record  size  equals  the  input
           record size.

2 FIXED[=n]

           Specifying a FIXED  format  transfer  always  reads  or
           writes fixed-length records.  No control information is
           stored in the file,  the  records  are  easily  located
           since they are all the same length.

           The FIXED=n option defines the length  of  fixed-length
           records.   In  the absence of an explicit length, FIXED
           format transfers default to  a  record  length  of  512
           bytes.

           As an input option, specifying a length is  only  valid
           for  non-Files-11 FIXED transfers.  It is not valid for
           STREAM,  Variable  or  BINARY  transfers,  because  the
           record  length  is  determined  by  the  delimiters  or
           control bytes.

           If any input records  are  longer  than  the  specified
           length,  the  records  will  be truncated and a message
           will be printed warning that one or more  records  were
           truncated.   If  input  records  are  shorter  than the
           output record, they  will  be  extended  with  the  pad
           character.   The  default  pad  character  is  the null
           character.  An alternate pad character can be specified
           with the PAD option.
2 STREAM

           Stream  ASCII  files  consist  of  ASCII  data  records
           terminated  by  carriage return/line feed (CR-LF), form
           feed (FF), or vertical  tab  (VT)  characters.   Stream
           files  are  sometimes called formatted ASCII files.  In
           transfers from DOS-11 or RT-11 STREAM files to Files-11
           Variable files, CR-LF pairs are removed from the end of
           records.  In transfers from Files-11 Variable files  to
           DOS-11  or RT-11 STREAM files, CR-LF pairs are added to
           the end of each record that does not already  end  with
           LF or FF.

           All null (NUL), delete (DEL),  and  vertical  tab  (VT)
           characters  are  removed  from  input records in any of
           these transfers.  ASCII data is  transferred  as  7-bit
           codes.   Bit 7 (sometimes used as a parity bit) of each
           byte is masked before transfer.

           If the RT-11 or DOS-11 file is (on input) or should  be
           (on  output)  an  ASCII  text  file  with  fixed-length
           records, use /RECORD_OPTION=FIXED=n rather than STREAM.
           Note that an ASCII stream file that happens to have all
           its records of the same length is not  the  same  as  a
           file   of  fixed-length  records.   STREAM  files  have
           records delimited by control characters.   FIXED  files
           have  no  delimiters;  records  are located by counting
           bytes.

           On  conversions  from  DOS-11  or  RT-11  to  Files-11,
           EXCHANGE  normally  generates  Files-11 variable-length
           records.  The  output  record  size  equals  the  input
           record    size.     Note    that    the    default   is
           RT-11 STREAM --> Files-11 Variable even  though  VAX-11
           RMS  supports  stream  format.  This choice was made so
           that a "typical" text file on RT-11 is converted  to  a
           "typical" text file on VMS.

           STREAM may not be used  with  Files-11  output.   If  a
           VAX-11  RMS stream format file is desired, use the /FDL
           option with  a  File  Definition  Language  file  which
           specifies  a  stream  file.   Note, however, that since
           there are slight differences between the VAX-11 RMS and
           the  RT-11  and  DOS-11  definition of STREAM format, a
           STREAM to STREAM copy might produce files  with  slight
           differences in control characters.

2 PAD=[%b]c

           The PAD option specifies which character will  be  used
           to  pad input records which are shorter than the fixed-
           length output record.  The default is to pad  with  the
           null   character  (value  zero).   /TRANSFER_MODE=BLOCK
           transfers are not padded.

           Pad characters are specified as follows:

                Option         Character

                PAD            NULL (00 Decimal)
                PAD=c          c is ASCII A-Z (capitals), or 0-9
                PAD="c"        c is any other ASCII character
                PAD=%bx        x is a number representing
                                 an ASCII character
                               b is the base of the number.
                                 Values for b are:

                                 D = decimal
                                 O = octal
                                 X = hexadecimal

2 Record_Defaults

 EXCHANGE will assume  defaults  for  the  record  formats  if  an
 explicit  /RECORD_FORMAT  qualifier  is  not  used.  The defaults
 depend on several factors, and are chosen so that it will usually
 be possible to transfer files without a /RECORD_FORMAT qualifier.

 The  only  option  which  applies  to  Files-11  input   is   the
 /TRANSFER_MODE=BLOCK  option.   In  the  absence  of  an explicit
 /TRANSFER_MODE=BLOCK option EXCHANGE will determine the file  and
 record  attributes stored by VAX-11 RMS.  Therefore, on the basis
 of the actual record format of the  file,  Files-11  input  files
 will  have  an  implied /RECORD_FORMAT option of FIXED, STREAM or
 Variable.

 For DOS-11 and RT-11, EXCHANGE assumes  record  formats  for  the
 DOS-11 or RT-11 file based on type field of the file name.  These
 default record formats are:


           File Type                          /RECORD_FORMAT=

           OBJ, STB, BIN, LDA                 BINARY

           EXE, %LB, SAV, SML, SYS, TSK       FIXED=512


 All other DOS-11 and RT-11 file  types  will  be  assumed  to  be
 STREAM format when used as input file specifications.  When other
 file types are used for output files, the default  record  format
 will depend on the record format of the input file.

 These defaults will be applied  only  for  transfers  between  an
 RT-11  or  DOS-11  volume  and  a Files-11 volume.  For transfers
 between an RT-11 or DOS-11 volume and  another  RT-11  or  DOS-11
 volume,  no reformatting will occur unless explicit record format
 qualifiers request a conversion.

 In other words, EXCHANGE  will  usually  apply  a  record  format
 default  to  the input file, and let the input file record format
 so produced imply the output record format.  However, presence of
 one  of  the  file  types  in  the  above  table  for  an  output
 specification will override the default implied by the input file
 record format.

 The following table shows the output record  formats  implied  by
 various input record and volume formats.  The input format can be
 either defaulted, read from the file (for Files-11),  implied  by
 the  input  file  name type field or explicitly stated.  Remember
 that these default output formats will be  overridden  by  record
 formats implied by output file name type fields.


           Input       Input               Output      Output
           Volume      Record              Volume      Record

           FILES11     FIXED               FILES11     FIXED
                       /TRANSFER=BLOCK                 FIXED
                       STREAM                          Variable
                       Variable                        Variable

                       FIXED               RT11,DOS11  FIXED
                       STREAM                          STREAM
                       Variable                        STREAM
                       Variable (OBJ etc)              BINARY
                       /TRANSFER=BLOCK                 FIXED


           RT11,DOS11  BINARY (OBJ etc)    FILES11     Variable
                       FIXED (EXE etc)                 FIXED
                       /TRANSFER=BLOCK                 FIXED
                       STREAM                          Variable


      For transfers between RT-11 and  DOS-11  the  file  will  be
      copied   block-by-block  unless  a  format  conversion  (for
      example, Stream to Binary) is specifically requested.
1 CarriageControl
 The /CARRIAGE_CONTROL qualifier is used to specify  the  carriage
 control  attributes  of a file.  It is useful for Files-11 output
 files only.
              EXCHANGE /CARRIAGE_CONTROL
       Option                           Function
      ------------     -----------------------------------------
      CARRIAGE_RETURN  Implied carriage-return/line-feed control
      FORTRAN          FORTRAN carriage control record attribute
      NONE             No implied carriage control

 The full meaning of these attributes follows:

2 CARRIAGE_RETURN

           This attribute indicates that  each  record  is  to  be
           preceded  by  a  line  feed  and followed by a carriage
           return when the record is written to a carriage control
           device such as a line printer or terminal.  This is the
           default carriage control attribute.

2 FORTRAN

           The FORTRAN option sets  the  FORTRAN  carriage-control
           record  attribute, which means that the first character
           of each record is to be  interpreted  as  the  carriage
           control  specifier.   This option does not alter any of
           the actual data.  FORTRAN is only valid  with  Files-11
           output  files.  The FORTRAN option is incompatible with
           stream output to Files-11.

2 NONE

           This option specifies that there should be no  carriage
           control  implied  for the file.  Each record is assumed
           to contain the control characters necessary for  proper
           formatting.
1 Transfer_Modes
 The /TRANSFER_MODE qualifier is used to specify the I/O method to
 be  used  in  a  transfer.   This option is useful for all volume
 formats.
               /TRANSFER_MODE Options
       Option                           Function
      -----------    ---------------------------------------------
      AUTOMATIC      Select  BLOCK  transfer  for  efficiency   if
                         possible
      BLOCK          Transfer block-by-block  without  looking  at
                         records
      RECORD         Transfer record-by-record

 A /TRANSFER_MODE=BLOCK transfer moves data between  devices.   No
 interpretation   is  done  on  the  data,  therefore  BLOCK  mode
 transfers are more efficient than  record  mode  transfers.   The
 block  sizes  on  both devices must be identical.  Both input and
 output   must   be   /TRANSFER_MODE=BLOCK   format.    Specifying
 /TRANSFER_MODE=BLOCK     on     one    parameter    will    imply
 /TRANSFER_MODE=BLOCK for the other file or device specification.

 A /TRANSFER_MODE=BLOCK transfer makes an exact copy of the  file.
 If  the  output device is Files-11, the file will be a sequential
 file  with  fixed-length  512-byte  records.   This  feature   is
 primarily  used  where  it  is  desired  to  absolutely avoid any
 interpretation of the data during the transfer.  If the  Files-11
 file  is  a  sequential  file with 512-byte fixed-length records,
 there is essentially no difference between a /TRANSFER_MODE=BLOCK
 transfer and a /RECORD=FIXED=512 transfer.

 A RECORD mode transfer  move  the  data  record-by-record.   This
 takes more time than BLOCK mode, but it is necessary if the input
 and output record structures differ.

 The default for EXCHANGE is to use AUTOMATIC transfer  mode.   In
 AUTOMATIC  mode, EXCHANGE will attempt to use BLOCK mode transfer
 whenever it is possible.  Block mode transfers are possible going
 from  RT-11  to  RT-11,  or  between  RT-11 and DOS-11, since the
 internal file structures are identical.  AUTOMATIC  wil  not  use
 block mode if either file specification contains a /RECORD_FORMAT
 qualifier.

 When the /LOG qualifier is used in a copy command, EXCHANGE tells
 the  size  of  the file which was transferred.  If BLOCK mode was
 used, the message will give the file size as the number of blocks
 transferred.   If  RECORD mode was used, the message will display
 the number of records.
1 Virtual_Devices
 A virtual-device is a VAX-11 RMS file which contains an image  of
 a  foreign  block-addressable device.  EXCHANGE treats a virtual-
 device as a foreign volume.

 EXCHANGE must  be  used  in  interactive  mode  to  manipulate  a
 virtual-device.  This restriction is necessary because a virtual-
 device must be mounted before it can be accessed.  Since EXCHANGE
 only  executes  a single command in DCL mode, it is impossible to
 both mount  and  operate  on  the  virtual  device  in  a  single
 DCL-level command.

 The EXCHANGE> MOUNT /VIRTUAL command has two parameters (vs.  one
 parameter  for MOUNT /FOREIGN).  The first parameter supplies the
 name of the virtual-device, the second parameter is the  name  of
 the  VAX-11  RMS  file  which  contains  the  device  image.  The
 virtual-device name is thereafter used as if it were the name  of
 a  physical  device.   This  virtual-device name is essentially a
 logical name which EXCHANGE uses to  locate  the  virtual-device.
 For example:


   EXCHANGE> mount /virtual disk: virtual.dsk
   %EXCHANGE-S-MOUNTVIR, the RT-11 virtual volume DISK: has been
              mounted using the file DRA2:<DISKS>VIRTUAL.DSK;1

   EXCHANGE> directory disk:

   Directory of RT-11 volume DISK:      16-MAR-1983 08:30
                       using DRA2:<DISKS>VIRTUAL.DSK;1

     ANSI.COM      1 16-Mar-1983     QARINV.TXT    3 16-Mar-1983
     REASSI.COM   13 16-Mar-1983     SYSCRE.MAC    1 16-Mar-1983

   Total of 4 files, 18 blocks.  Free space 4944 blocks, largest 4474.

   EXCHANGE> copy /log sys$login:work.txt disk:
   %EXCHANGE-S-COPIED, _SLOTH$DUA17:<HOBBS.WRKD$.LOGIN>WORK.TXT;10 
                         copied to DISK:WORK.TXT, 73 records

 The name "DISK:" is used exactly like a device name.  Be  careful
 not  to  assign  virtual-device  names  which are the same as any
 logical names that you might want to use.  EXCHANGE  will  assume
 that  any  use  of  the name refers to the virtual-device, rather
 than the logical name.

2 Creating 

 To create a new virtual device, use the  /CREATE  option  to  the
 EXCHANGE  INITIALIZE verb.  Use the /ALLOCATION option to set the
 size of the  virtual  device.   The  default  allocation  is  494
 blocks, the same size as a single-density floppy diskette.

2 Example

 To see an  extended  example  of  the  use  of  EXCHANGE  virtual
 devices, please examine the command file SYS$UPDATE:CONSCOPY.COM.
 This command file is used to  make  a  backup  copy  of  the  VAX
 processor  console  block  storage  volume.  It creates a virtual
 device and copies the console files to the virtual  device.   The
 restore  operation copies files from the virtual device back onto
 the console volume.

2 RTEM_Virt_Devs

 With one exception, EXCHANGE virtual devices are identical to the
 virtual  devices  maintained  by the VAX-11 RTEM (RT-11 Emulator)
 layered product.  EXCHANGE can manipulate RTEM  virtual  devices,
 and vice versa.

 The exception is that EXCHANGE does not fully recognize the  RTEM
 shared  virtual  volumes.   EXCHANGE  can  be used to read shared
 virtual volumes, but not  to  write  to  them.   When  the  MOUNT
 /VIRTUAL  command  is  given  on  an  RTEM shared virtual device,
 EXCHANGE will print a message that one or more directory  entries
 are  not  in  a  known  format,  and  that  the  volume  will  be
 write-locked to avoid corrupting the shared volume.
1 COPY
 The EXCHANGE command COPY transfers a file or  files  from  the  input
 volume to the output volume.  EXCHANGE> COPY can:

      o  Copy a file between a foreign volume and a native volume
      o  Copy a file from one foreign volume to another foreign volume
      o  Convert the format of the file during the transfer
      o  Copy groups of files between volumes
      o  Give the output file a different name from the input

 Format
         EXCHANGE>  COPY   input-file-spec[,...]   output-file-spec

 Prompts
         Input file(s):  input-file-spec[,...]

         Output file:    output-file-spec
2 Parameters

   input-file-spec[,...]

      Specifies the names of one or more input files to be copied.   If
      you  specify more than one input file, you can separate them with
      either commas (,) or plus signs (+).  Standard VAX/VMS wild cards
      can  be specified in file names, both Files-11 and foreign.  Wild
      card directories are supported for Files-11 and DOS-11 input.

      The syntax for the file names depends on  the  particular  volume
      format   option   present   or  implied.   See  Section  6.0  for
      descriptions of the volume format options.

   output-file-spec

      Specifies the name of the output file,  directory  or  device  to
      which  the input files are to be copied.  An explicit output name
      (that is, a rename during copy) can only be given  if  the  input
      specifies  a  single  file.   If  the input-file-spec potentially
      specifies multiple files, the output-file-spec must be one of:

           o  Wild cards (*, *.* or *.*;*) specifying  current  default
              device and directory
           o  An explicit device and/or directory for Files-11  output,
              such as CW:<EXCHANGE.TMP>, with or without wild cards for
              the file name
           o  An explicit device for RT-11 as in DLA2:/VOLUME=RT11
           o  An explicit device or directory for DOS-11  output,  such
              as TAPE:/VOLUME=DOS11 or TAPE:<11,132>/VOLUME=DOS11

      The output file name(s) will be constructed  according  to  rules
      implied by the input and output volume qualifiers.  EXCHANGE COPY
      does not concatenate multiple input files into  a  single  output
      file.  Wild card directories are not permitted.

      The syntax  for  the  output  file  names  is  dependent  on  the
      particular  volume  format  qualifier  present  or  implied.  See
      Section 6.0 for descriptions of the volume format qualifier.

      You  must  specify  at  least  one  field  in  the  output   file
      specification.  The EXCHANGE COPY command replaces missing fields
      with  the  corresponding  field  of  the   related   input   file
      specification.   If  the  input  file has no corresponding field,
      EXCHANGE COPY will  substitute  null  text  fields  and  maximize
      version numbers.

      The UIC of the output file is the UIC  of  the  current  process.
      For  DOS-11  output, EXCHANGE uses the current default directory,
      if it is in UIC format;  otherwise, it uses the current process's
      UIC as a directory.  An alternate directory for DOS-11 output may
      be specified in the command.   Additionally,  the  /UIC_DIRECTORY
      qualifier may be used to determine the output DOS-11 directory.
2 Description

      The EXCHANGE COPY command transfers a  file  or  files  from  the
      input volume to the output volume.

      Multiple output files can be created by specifying multiple input
      files.  When multiple output files are created, the corresponding
      field from each input file is used in the output file name.

      When no version number field is specified  for  Files-11  output,
      the  EXCHANGE COPY command gives the output file a version number
      that is one of the following:

           o  The same version number as the input file, if  the  input
              volume  structure  supports  version  numbers and no file
              exists with the same name and type
           o  A version number one greater  than  the  highest  version
              number  of  an  existing file with the same file name and
              file type
           o  Version 1 if neither of the above applies

      When the output file version number is specified by  an  asterisk
      (*)  wild  card  character,  the  EXCHANGE  COPY command uses the
      version numbers of the associated input files,  if  any,  as  the
      version numbers of the output files.

      Files-11 magnetic tapes  (ANSI)  do  not  treat  version  numbers
      exactly  like disks.  Please see the VAX/VMS Magnetic Tape User's
      Guide for an explanation of version numbers on tapes.

      Files may have to be reformatted during the copy operation.   The
      defaults  for  reformatting  are  dependent  on the volume format
      qualifiers  attached  to  both  the   input   and   output   file
      specifications,   as   well   as  the  type  field  of  the  file
      specification.  See Section 7.0 for descriptions of the  defaults
      and  of  the  /RECORD_FORMAT qualifier, which is used to override
      the defaults.
2 Qualifiers
/BOOT

      This qualifier copies bootstrap information from  a  monitor
      file  to  blocks  0  and  2  through  5  of an RT-11 volume,
      permitting you to use that volume as a system  volume.   The
      COPY/BOOT operation does not create any files on the volume,
      it is a special purpose command  to  create  bootable  RT-11
      systems.   Please  note  that  this  command  can not create
      bootstraps in the format used by RT-11 V4 and later.  It can
      be  used  with  versions  of RT-11 up through Version 3, and
      with the RT-11 system used by the PDP-11 console  processors
      on certain VAX-11 processors.

      The /BOOT qualifier only allows a single parameter, the name
      of the monitor file.  The /BOOT qualifier cannot be combined
      with qualifiers other than /LOG.
/LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

      Controls   whether   EXCHANGE   COPY   displays   the   file
      specifications of each file copied.

      If you specify /LOG, the EXCHANGE COPY command displays, for
      each  copy  operation,  the file specifications of the input
      and output files and the number of blocks or the  number  of
      records copied (depending on whether the file is copied on a
      block-by-block or record-by-record basis).

      If it is necessary to change the name of a file because  the
      output  device does not support the format of the file name,
      EXCHANGE will log the names (old and new) of the  file  even
      if the /LOG qualifier is not used.  To prevent EXCHANGE from
      logging name changes, use the /NOLOG qualifier explicitly.
/ALLOCATION

 /ALLOCATION=n

      Forces the initial allocation of the output file to the number of
      512-byte  blocks  specified  as n.  /ALLOCATION is only valid for
      Files-11 and RT-11 output files.

      If not specified, the initial allocation of the  output  file  is
      determined by the size of the input file being copied.  In normal
      use, /ALLOCATION is needed only when:

           o  Creating   a   contiguous   file   on   Files-11    (with
              /BEST_TRY_CONTIGUOUS  or /CONTIGUOUS) when the input file
              is on magnetic tape
           o  Additional space is desired at the end of the file

      If /ALLOCATION is specified, EXCHANGE COPY will leave the file at
      the   allocated   size   unless   /TRUNCATE  is  also  specified.
      Specifying both an allocation and /TRUNCATE is  useful  when  the
      exact output size is not known beforehand.

      The /ALLOCATION qualifier  can  also  be  used  to  override  the
      allocation  value  specified  in an FDL file.  Note that only the
      file allocation can be overridden, EXCHANGE does not change  area
      allocation values if the FDL specifies area allocations.
/BEST_TRY_CONTIGUOUS

 /BEST_TRY_CONTIGUOUS
 /NOBEST_TRY_CONTIGUOUS

      Indicates whether the output file is to be allocated contiguously
      on  a  "best  effort"  basis  --  that  is, whether EXCHANGE will
      attempt to place the file on consecutive  physical  disk  blocks.
      If  insufficient  contiguous  space  is  available, the file will
      occupy the largest available  contiguous  space  plus  additional
      extents  as  necessary  for  the  rest  of  the allocation.  This
      qualifier can only be applied to a Files-11 output file.

      By default, EXCHANGE COPY will never attempt to create a file  on
      a best-try-contiguous basis.

      The /BEST_TRY_CONTIGUOUS qualifier has no effect  when  you  copy
      files  to  magnetic  tapes.  When you copy a file from a tape and
      want the file to be contiguous if possible, you need to  use  the
      /ALLOCATION qualifier along with /BEST_TRY_CONTIGUOUS because the
      size of the file on tape cannot be determined until after  it  is
      copied  to the disk.  If only the approximate size of the file is
      known, you can overestimate the size and specify /TRUNCATE (along
      with /ALLOCATION and /BEST_TRY_CONTIGUOUS) to avoid wasted space.
/CARRIAGE_CONTROL

 /CARRIAGE_CONTROL=option

      The /CARRIAGE_CONTROL  qualifier  defines  the  carriage  control
      attributes of a file.  and other attributes of the records.

              Option                    Function

           CARRIAGE_RETURN  Implied carriage-return/line-feed control
           FORTRAN          FORTRAN carriage control record attribute
           NONE             No implied carriage control

      See  HELP  CarriageControl  for a  complete  description  of  the
      /CARRIAGE_CONTROL qualifier and the defaults.
/CONTIGUOUS

 /CONTIGUOUS
 /NOCONTIGUOUS

      Indicates whether the output file is to be contiguous -- that is,
      whether  the  file  must occupy consecutive physical disk blocks.
      This qualifier can only be applied to a Files-11 output file.

      By default, EXCHANGE COPY never creates a contiguous output file.

      The /CONTIGUOUS qualifier has no effect when you  copy  files  to
      magnetic  tapes.   When  you copy a file from a tape and want the
      file to be contiguous, you need to use the /ALLOCATION  qualifier
      along  with  /CONTIGUOUS  because  the  size  of the file on tape
      cannot be determined until after it is copied to  the  disk.   If
      the  size  of  the  file  is  only  approximately  known, you can
      overestimate  the  size  and  specify   /TRUNCATE   (along   with
      /ALLOCATION and /CONTIGUOUS) to avoid wasted space.
/DELETE

 /DELETE
 /NODELETE

      This  qualifier  controls  whether  EXCHANGE  COPY  will   delete
      existing  files of the same name during the copy operation.  This
      is valid for RT-11 output only.

      The  default  is  /DELETE;    EXCHANGE   will   delete   existing
      identically  named files after the new file is copied.  A message
      will be printed if /LOG is also  in  effect.   Use  /NODELETE  to
      prevent  automatic file deletion.  The /REPLACE qualifier is also
      used to  control  file  deletion,  but  the  action  is  somewhat
      different.

      This qualifier is equivalent to the RT-11 COPY command  qualifier
      /REPLACE.
/EXTENSION

 /EXTENSION=n

      Specifies the number of blocks to be added  to  the  output  file
      each  time  the  file  is  extended.   This is valid for Files-11
      output files only.

      EXCHANGE  determines  the  default  extension  according  to  the
      following hierarchy:

             1. An explicit  value  specified  on  the  /EXTENSION
                qualifier
             2. When the /FDL qualifier is used, the value of  the
                EXTENSION  secondary under the FILE primary in the
                FDL description
             3. The current process default extension value as set
                by the SET RMS_DEFAULT command
             4. The current system default extension value as  set
                at    system    generation   or   with   the   SET
                RMS_DEFAULT/SYSTEM command

      Setting an extension quantity is normally  useful  with  magnetic
      tape  input  only,  since EXCHANGE will preallocate a file of the
      correct size when the input is on a directory-structured  device.
      The  /EXTENSION  qualifier  can  also  be  used  to  override the
      extension value specified in an FDL file.   Note  that  only  the
      file  extension  can be overridden, EXCHANGE does not change area
      extension values if the FDL specifies area extensions.
/FDL

 /FDL=file-spec                 <not implemented for Field Test 1>

      Specifies the FDL file to use in creating the output  file.   The
      default file type for the FDL file is FDL.

      The newly created output file will have the name specified by the
      output   file   specification.   This  name  overrides  the  name
      specified in the FDL file.  It is possible to specify  additional
      file attribute qualifiers (such as /ALLOCATION or /RECORD_FORMAT)
      along with the /FDL qualifier.  When this is done, the additional
      qualifiers will override the information in the FDL file.

      The File Definition Language is described in detail in the VAX-11
      Record Management Services Utilities Reference Manual.
/PROTECT

 /PROTECT
 /NOPROTECT

      Defines the protection to be applied to  an  RT-11  output  file.
      RT-11   files   are  either  protected  (/PROTECT  specified)  or
      unprotected (/NOPROTECT, the default).

      This  qualifier  in  not  valid  for   Files-11   output   files.
      Protection  attributes  for  Files-11  output  are taken from the
      current process default protection.  It is  possible  to  specify
      alternate  protections  for  Files-11 output files using the /FDL
      qualifier.  For example, to only change protection you could  use
      a command like:

           $ EXCHANGE COPY /LOG CSA1:DEFBOO.CMD SYS$LOGIN:/FDL=SYS$INPUT
           file
               protection    (system=rwed, group=rwed, world=rwed)
           ^Z
           %EXCHANGE-S-COPIED, _CSA1:DEFBOO.CMD copied to
                            WRKD$:<HOBBS.LOGIN>DEFBOO.CMD;1, 46 records
           $

      In this example the /FDL=SYS$INPUT specifies that  the  FDL  file
      will  be  entered  from  the terminal (or command file).  The FDL
      file needs only the PROTECTION secondary for  the  FILE  primary.
      The control/Z (^Z) is used to terminate the FDL file.

      The /PROTECT qualifier is invalid with DOS-11 output files.

      EXCHANGE does not attempt to transfer protection attributes  from
      the  input file to the output file, because protection mechanisms
      of various operating systems do  not  readily  translate  to  one
      another.

      The owner UIC of the output  file  is  the  UIC  of  the  current
      process.
/RECORD_FORMAT

 /RECORD_FORMAT=(option[,...])

      The /RECORD_FORMAT qualifier  defines  the  internal  record
      structure of a file and other attributes of the records.

              Option                    Function

           BINARY         Identifies   formatted    binary    mode
                          transfers
           FIXED          Identifies fixed-length record format
           STREAM         Identifies ASCII stream mode transfers
           PAD            Sets the character to pad short  records
                          on fixed-length output, valid with FIXED
                          only
/REPLACE

 /REPLACE
 /NOREPLACE

      Requests that if an RT-11 output file  already  exists  with  the
      same  file specification as that entered for the output file, the
      existing file is to be deleted before  the  copy  proceeds.   The
      EXCHANGE  COPY  command  allocates new space for the output file.
      This is valid for RT-11 output only.

      By default on RT-11 output, EXCHANGE COPY creates  the  new  file
      and  then  deletes  the existing file after the copy successfully
      completes.  With /REPLACE, COPY deletes the file before  starting
      the  transfer.   This is useful if there is insufficient room for
      two copies of the file.  Be careful when  you  use  the  /REPLACE
      option  with  RT-11  output;  if for any reason the input file is
      unreadable, the output file will already have  been  deleted  and
      you will be left with no usable version of the file.

      This qualifier is equivalent to the RT-11 COPY command  qualifier
      /PREDELETE.
/REWIND

 /REWIND
 /NOREWIND


      Causes the input tape reel to be rewound  (/REWIND)  or  not
      rewound  (/NOREWIND)  to  beginning-of-tape  before EXCHANGE
      searches for the file name specified in the input specifier.

      Use this qualifier only  for  DOS-11  magnetic  tapes.   The
      /NOREWIND  qualifier  is  the  default; use /REWIND when you
      want COPY to start searching for a file at the beginning  of
      the tape rather than starting at the current position.

      Note that EXCHANGE maintains an internal list of  the  files
      on  a  DOS-11 tape, and that the /REWIND qualifier might not
      cause an actual rewind of the tape volume.   It  does  cause
      EXCHANGE  to  start  the  search  at  the  beginning  of the
      internal list, however.

/START_BLOCK

 /START_BLOCK=n

      For RT-11 volumes the /START_BLOCK qualifier can be used  to
      specify  the  logical  block number where the file should be
      placed.  This  can  be  especially  useful  with  TU58  data
      cartridges,   because   performance   can  be  significantly
      enhanced by careful placement of files.
/TRANSFER_MODE

 /TRANSFER_MODE=option

      The  /TRANSFER_MODE  option  determines  how  EXCHANGE  will
      transfer the file.   See  Transfer_Modes for a more complete
      description of /TRANSFER_MODE.
/TRUNCATE

 /TRUNCATE
 /NOTRUNCATE

      Controls whether the EXCHANGE COPY command  truncates  an  output
      file  at  the  end-of-file when copying it.  By default, the COPY
      command uses the allocation of the input file  to  determine  the
      size of the output file.
/VOLUME_FORMAT

 /VOLUME_FORMAT=option

      The /VOLUME_FORMAT qualifier defines the physical format  of  the
      volume   to  be  processed.   The  default  format  qualifier  is
      dependent on the device type.  The default is /VOLUME_FORMAT=RT11
      for    block-addressable    devices    mounted    foreign,    and
      /VOLUME_FORMAT=DOS11 for magnetic tape devices  mounted  foreign.
      The default for devices mounted native is /VOLUME_FORMAT=FILES11,
      the VAX/VMS native volume format.

           Option                       Function

           FILES11        Identifies a Files-11 formatted native volume
           RT11           Identifies   an   RT-11   formatted    block-
                          addressable volume
           DOS11          Identifies a DOS-11 formatted  magnetic  tape
                          volume

      Volume format qualifiers must be attached to one or both  of  the
      file  specification  parameters, they cannot be attached directly
      to the verb.  A volume format qualifier determines the format  of
      the  file name and directory specifications, and will often imply
      certain defaults.

      See section 6.0 for a complete description of the  /VOLUME_FORMAT
      qualifier and the defaults.
2 Examples

  1.  EXCHANGE> COPY  TEST.DAT  DYA0:NEWTST.DAT

      The COPY command copies the contents of  the  file  TEST.DAT
      from  the  default  disk  and  directory  into  a file named
      NEWTST.DAT on the RT-11 floppy diskette mounted on DYA0.  If
      a  file  named  NEWTST.DAT already existed, the COPY command
      will have replaced it.  The  record  formats  are  variable-
      length  on  the Files-11 input and ASCII stream on the RT-11
      output.

  2.  EXCHANGE> COPY/LOG  TEST.DAT  DYA0:NEWTST.DAT
      %EXCHANGE-S-DELETEPREV, previous copy of DYA0:NEWTST.DAT deleted
      %EXCHANGE-S-COPIED, WRKD$:<FRED>TEST.DAT;5
                   copied to  DYA0:NEWTST.DAT, 93 records

      This COPY command is the  same  as  the  preceding  example,
      except  that the /LOG qualifier was used so that the actions
      of the command would be seen.  The /VOLUME_FORMAT  qualifier
      has  not  been used, since EXCHANGE will default to RT11 for
      the foreign-mounted floppy.  Since NEWTST.DAT was already on
      the  floppy  from  the  first example, the first copy of the
      file was deleted after  the  second  copy  was  successfully
      transferred.

  3.  EXCHANGE> COPY/LOG  LARGE.DAT  DYA0:
      %EXCHANGE-S-DELETEPREV, previous copy of _DYA0:LARGE.DAT deleted
      %EXCHANGE-W-RTOUTEOF, end-of-file on output _DYA0:LARGE.DAT,
                             insufficient space on volume
      %EXCHANGE-I-PARTCOPIED, WRKD$:<FRED>LARGE.DAT;9 partially copied to
                             _DYA0:LARGE.DAT, 1670 records

      EXCHANGE> COPY/LOG/REPLACE  LARGE.DAT  DYA0:
      %EXCHANGE-S-DELETEPREV, previous copy of _DYA0:LARGE.DAT deleted
      %EXCHANGE-S-COPIED, WRKD$:<FRED>LARGE.DAT;9 copied to
                             _DYA0:LARGE.DAT, 3288 records

      The first COPY failed because there was not enough  room  on
      DYA0:   for  EXCHANGE  to do a normal copy (that is, to copy
      the file into a temporary on DYA0:, delete the existing file
      of the same name, and then rename the temporary).

      The /REPLACE qualifier requests  that  EXCHANGE  COPY  first
      delete an existing version of the output file before copying
      the new file.  The  first  message  from  the  COPY  command
      indicates  that it is deleting an existing file.  The second
      message informs of the completed copy.

  4.  EXCHANGE> COPY  MTA0:<11,132>*.COM  <FRED.TEMP>

      The COPY command copies all the files with a  file  type  of
      COM  owned  by UIC <11,132> to the subdirectory <FRED.TEMP>.
      The DOS-11 record format will  be  STREAM  by  default,  the
      Files-11 format will be variable-length records.

  5.  EXCHANGE> COPY/BOOT  DYA0:RT11SJ.SYS  DYA0:

      This COPY/BOOT command makes the  diskette  mounted  on  the
      RX02 drive DYA0:  a bootable RT-11 system.  Boot information
      is written to use the RT-11 single job monitor (RT11SJ.SYS).
      The diskette could be formatted in single or double density.

  6.  EXCHANGE> COPY/BOOT  CSA1:CONSOL.SYS  CSA1:

      This  COPY/BOOT  command  writes  boot  information  on  the
      console storage device on a VAX-11 processor.

  8.  EXCHANGE> COPY  DMA0:FROG.DAT/RECORD=STREAM -
      _EXCHANGE>  FROG4JUN.DAT/RECORD=(FIXED=80,PAD=" ")

      This command copies an  ASCII  stream  file  (which  is  the
      default)  from an RT-11 volume to the current default device
      and directory.  The  output  contains  fixed-length  records
      that are padded to 80 bytes with the space character.
1 DELETE
 Deletes one or  more  files  from  a  foreign  block-addressable  mass
 storage volume.  EXCHANGE does not delete files from Files-11 volumes.

 Format
           EXCHANGE>  DELETE   file-spec[,...]

 Prompt
           Filename(s):  file-spec[,...]
2 Parameters

 file-spec[,...]

      Specifies the names of one or more files to be deleted.  You  can
      specify  wild  card  characters  in any of the file specification
      fields.

      To delete more than one file, separate  the  file  specifications
      with commas (,) or plus signs (+).

      RT-11 recognizes two file extensions (types)  as  having  special
      significance,  and EXCHANGE mimics the special actions that RT-11
      takes with respect to these files.  The first  of  these  specail
      files  is  a  file with an extension of ".SYS".  EXCHANGE> DELETE
      does not delete a file with  an  extension  of  .SYS  unless  the
      /SYSTEM  qualifier  is present.  EXCHANGE will print a message if
      one or more .SYS files are passed over during a delete operation.

      The second special file type is ".BAD".  EXCHANGE does not delete
      .BAD  files if the file specification contains wildcards.  A .BAD
      file may be deleted by explicitly specifying its name.   EXCHANGE
      does not warn that .BAD files have not been deleted.
2 Qualifiers
/LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

      Controls whether the EXCHANGE DELETE command  displays  the  file
      specification of each file after its deletion.

      By default, the DELETE command does  not  display  the  names  of
      files after it deletes them.
/SYSTEM

 /SYSTEM
 /NOSYSTEM

      Controls whether the EXCHANGE DELETE command deletes files  which
      have a file extension of ".SYS".  These files are typically files
      which are necessary for the operation of an RT-11  system.   Only
      RT-11 volumes treat .SYS files in this special manner.

      By default, the DELETE command will not delete an RT-11 file with
      a  .SYS  extension,  whether  it is matched by a wildcard spec or
      explicitly named.  EXCHANGE will  print  a  message  whenever  it
      skips over a .SYS file during a delete operation.

      EXCHANGE also treats files with ".BAD" extensions as special, but
      the /SYSTEM qualifier does not affect the operations against .BAD
      files.  To delete a .BAD file, specify the  filename  explicitly,
      rather  than  using  wildcards.  EXCHANGE does not warn that .BAD
      files are being skipped.
/VOLUME_FORMAT

 /VOLUME_FORMAT=option

      The /VOLUME_FORMAT qualifier defines the physical format  of  the
      volume  to  be  processed.   RT-11 volumes are currently the only
      volumes on which DELETE is supported.   See  section  6.0  for  a
      complete  description  of  the  /VOLUME_FORMAT  qualifier and the
      defaults.
2 Examples

      1.  EXCHANGE>  DELETE   DMA0:COMMON.SUM

          The DELETE command deletes the file COMMON.SUM from  the
          RT-11 device DMA0:.

      2.  EXCHANGE>  DELETE   DXA0:*.OLD/LOG

          The DELETE command attempts to  delete  all  files  with
          file  types  of  OLD from the floppy diskette.  EXCHANGE
          will log the name of each file deleted.

      3.  EXCHANGE>  MOUNT /VIRTUAL  TEST:  TEST.DSK
          EXCHANGE>  DELETE  TEST:ALPHA.TXT,BETA.TXT

          The DELETE  command  deletes  the  files  ALPHA.TXT  and
          BETA.TXT from the virtual-device file TEST.DSK.
1 DIRECTORY
 Provides a list of files or information  about  a  file  or  group  of
 files.   The  files must reside on a foreign volume, EXCHANGE does not
 list directories of Files-11 volumes.

 Format
           EXCHANGE>  DIRECTORY   [file-spec[,...]]

 Prompts
           None.
2 Parameters

 file-spec[,...]

      Specifies one or more files to  be  listed.   The  /VOLUME_FORMAT
      qualifier determines the syntax of a file specification.

      If  you  specify  more  than  one   file,   separate   the   file
      specifications with either commas (,) or plus signs (+).  You can
      use wild card characters in  the  directory  specification,  file
      name, file type, or version number fields of a file specification
      to list all files that satisfy the components you specify.


2 Description

      The output of the DIRECTORY command depends on the volume  format
      and  on  certain formatting qualifiers and their defaults.  These
      qualifiers are:  /ALL, /BLOCKS, /BRIEF, /COLUMNS,  /DATE,  /FULL,
      /OCTAL,  and  /SIZE.   The files that are listed always appear in
      the order they appear in the volume directory, or the order  they
      are on a magnetic tape.
2 Qualifiers
/ALL

 /ALL
 /NOALL

      The /ALL qualifier is used to list all deleted or unused files on
      an  RT-11  volume,  in  addition  to  other files selected by the
      command.  For example, the command

           EXCHANGE> DIRECTORY  DMA0:*.MAC/ALL

      lists all MACRO-11 source files, plus deleted and unused files.
/BLOCKS

 /BLOCKS
 /NOBLOCKS

      The /BLOCKS qualifier lists the  starting  block  number  of  the
      file.   This  is  only valid for directories of block-addressable
      devices.  The first block of the device is block number 0.
/BRIEF

 /BRIEF
 /NOBRIEF

      Includes only the file name of each file to  be  listed.   /BRIEF
      format is equivalent to /NODATE/NOSIZE.
/COLUMNS

 /COLUMNS=n

      Lists the files using the specified number  of  columns  on  each
      line  of the display.  This qualifier is used in conjunction with
      the /BRIEF qualifier  (either  explicitly  or  by  default).   By
      default,  the number of columns is dependent on the volume format
      and the information requested.  EXCHANGE DIRECTORY  will  attempt
      to  use  as  many  columns  as possible.  If too many columns are
      requested, a message will be printed and the  number  of  columns
      will be reduced to the number that will fit on the listing.
/DATE

 /DATE
 /NODATE

      Includes the date  for  each  file  listed.   If  you  omit  this
      qualifier, the default is /DATE.
/DELETED

 /DELETED
 /NODELETED

      This qualifier lists a directory of files that have been  deleted
      from  an  RT-11  device,  but whose file name information has not
      been destroyed.

      The listing icludes the file names, types, sizes, creation  dates
      and  starting block numbers (in decimal unless /OCTAL is used) of
      the deleted files.  The file  names  that  print  also  represent
      tentative files.

      The /DELETED  qualifier  is  only  valid  with  block-addressable
      volumes with volume formats of RT11.
/FREE

 /FREE
 /NOFREE

      The /FREE qualifier is  used  to  include  unused  areas  in  the
      directory  listing.   The /FREE qualifier is only valid with RT11
      format volumes.
/FULL

      The /FULL qualifier lists all the available information for  each
      file.   The  exact  format  of  the listing depends on the volume
      format qualifier.

      The /FULL qualifier overrides the default brief listing format.
/OCTAL

 /OCTAL
 /NOOCTAL

      Controls whether numeric information is  printed  in  decimal  or
      octal  format.   The  default is /NOOCTAL, numbers are printed in
      decimal radix.  Dates are always printed in decimal format.
/OUTPUT

 /OUTPUT[=file-spec]

      Requests that the DIRECTORY command output be written to the file
      specified  rather  than to the current SYS$OUTPUT device.  If you
      specify the /OUTPUT qualifier without a file  specification,  the
      output  is  directed to SYS$OUTPUT.  If you omit the file type in
      the file specification, the default file type  is  LIS.   If  you
      specify a file type and omit the file name, the default file name
      is EXCHDIRE.

      No wild card characters are allowed in the file specification.

/OWNER

 /OWNER
 /NOOWNER

      The /OWNER qualifier includes information about the owner of
      the  files.  For DOS-11 magtapes, the owner field is the UIC
      of the files owner.  For RT-11 disks, the owner  information
      is a single line listing the volume owner as recorded in the
      volume home block.
/PRINTER

      Queues the command output for printing under the  name  given  by
      the  /OUTPUT  qualifier.   If  you  specify  /PRINTER without the
      /OUTPUT qualifier,  the  output  is  directed  to  a  file  named
      EXCHDIRE.LIS,  which  is  spooled  for printing automatically and
      then deleted.
/SIZE

 /SIZE
 /NOSIZE

      Provides the file size in blocks used for each file  listed.   If
      you omit this qualifier, the default is /SIZE.
/SUMMARY

 /SUMMARY
 /NOSUMMARY

      This qualifier lists a summary of  the  usage  of  the  directory
      segments for an RT-11 volume.
/VOLUME_FORMAT

 /VOLUME_FORMAT=option

      The /VOLUME_FORMAT qualifier defines the physical format  of  the
      volume   to  be  processed.   The  default  format  qualifier  is
      dependent on the device type.  The default  is  /VOLUME=RT11  for
      block-addressable  devices mounted foreign, and /VOLUME=DOS11 for
      magnetic tape devices mounted foreign.  DIRECTORY  is  not  valid
      for devices mounted native.

           Option                       Function

           RT11           Identifies   an   RT-11   formatted    block-
                          addressable volume
           DOS11          Identifies a DOS-11 formatted  magnetic  tape
                          volume

      The volume format qualifier also determines  the  format  of  the
      directory listing.

      See section 6.0 for a complete description of the  /VOLUME_FORMAT
      qualifier and the defaults.
2 Examples
                                      .
      1.  EXCHANGE>  DIRECTORY   DLA2:.OBJ/FULL

          The DIRECTORY command lists all files with the type  OBJ
          on  the  RT-11  volume mounted on DLA2:.  The file sizes
          and dates will be listed along with the names.

      2.  EXCHANGE>  DIRECTORY   MFA0:

          The DIRECTORY command lists all files on the DOS-11 tape
          mounted on MFA0:.

      3.  EXCHANGE>  DIRECTORY   DYA0:/BLOCKS

          The DIRECTORY command lists the  files  on  the  floppy,
          along  with  the  logical  block  number where each file
          starts.
1 DISMOUNT
 Releases a volume previously accessed with the EXCHANGE MOUNT command.

 Format
           EXCHANGE>  DISMOUNT   device-name[:]

 Prompt
           Device:  device-name[:]
2 Parameters

 device-name[:]

      Specifies the name of the  device  to  be  dismounted.   You  can
      specify  a  physical  device name or a logical name assigned to a
      physical device name.   If  you  omit  a  controller  designation
      and/or  a  unit  number, they default to controller A and unit 0,
      respectively.  You can also specify the name of a virtual-device.
2 Description

      The  DISMOUNT  command  closes  all  connections  that   EXCHANGE
      maintains  to the device.  This command does not affect the state
      of the operating system mount, the device remains mounted in  the
      VMS sense.

      Only foreign devices may be  dismounted.   An  implicit  DISMOUNT
      command is executed when EXCHANGE exits.
2 Qualifier
/MESSAGE

 /MESSAGE
 /NOMESSAGE

      The /MESSAGE qualifier  controls  whether  or  not  EXCHANGE
      prints  a message which says that the volume was dismounted.
      The default is determined by the /MESSAGE qualifier  on  the
      EXCHANGE verb when EXCHANGE was activated.
2 Examples

      1.  EXCHANGE>  MOUNT/FOREIGN   MTA0:
          EXCHANGE>  COPY   MTA0:AVERAGE.FOR/VOLUME=DOS11   *
          EXCHANGE>  DISMOUNT   MTA0:

          The MOUNT command mounts the tape on the  device  MTA0:.   An
          EXCHANGE  COPY  command  is  used to transfer a file from the
          tape.  The DISMOUNT command releases EXCHANGE's access to the
          volume.  The volume is still mounted on the system, however.
1 EXIT
 Terminates execution of EXCHANGE.  Control  is  returned  to  the  DCL
 command level.

 Format
         EXCHANGE>  EXIT

 Prompts
          None.
2 Description

      The EXCHANGE EXIT  command  terminates  an  interactive  session.
      Control/Z (^Z) can also be used to exit EXCHANGE.
2 Examples

      1.  EXCHANGE>  EXIT

          EXCHANGE terminates, returning to the DCL command level.
1 HELP
 Displays on the current  default  output  stream  device  (SYS$OUTPUT)
 information on EXCHANGE commands and qualifiers.

 Format
         EXCHANGE>  HELP   [command-verb [qualifier [option [option]]]]

 Prompts
         None.
2 Parameters

 command-verb

      Specifies the name of the EXCHANGE verb about  which  information
      is  desired.   Omitting  the  command  verb  will display general
      information listing all commands recognized by EXCHANGE.

 qualifier

      Gives the name of the qualifier to be explained.


2 Description

      Information is located in a hierarchical manner, depending on the
      level  of  information  required.   The  lowest  level of help is
      obtained by entering  HELP  without  any  arguments.   HELP  will
      display a list summarizing the available first level information,
      the names of the EXCHANGE commands.

      The first level of help is  the  command  description.   Entering
      HELP  followed  by  the  name  of  an  EXCHANGE command verb will
      display  a  description  of  the  command,  followed  by  a  list
      summarizing the help available at the next level.

      The second level  of  help  is  for  command  qualifiers.   Enter
      HELP verb qualifier   for   this   level  of  help,  for  example
      HELP COPY /CONTIGUOUS.

      Deeper levels of help continue in this fashion,  giving  help  on
      options to qualifiers and other information.

      If you specify an asterisk (*) in place of any keyword, the  HELP
      command displays all information available at that level.

      If you specify an ellipsis (...) after any  keyword,  you  obtain
      everything in the help file for deeper levels.

      You can specify percent signs (%) and asterisks () in the keyword
      as wild card characters.
2 Examples

      1.  EXCHANGE>  HELP

          This command explains the HELP command, and lists a table  of
          EXCHANGE commands for which more help is available.

      2.  EXCHANGE>  HELP  COPY  /VOLUME...

          This command displays all the help which is available for the
          COPY /VOLUME_FORMAT qualifier, including descriptions of each
          of the options.
1 INITIALIZE
 Formats and writes a label on a  foreign  mass  storage  volume.   For
 directory-structured   devices,   the   device   directory   is   also
 initialized.

 Format
           EXCHANGE>  INITIALIZE   device-name
           EXCHANGE>  INITIALIZE /CREATE   file-name

 Prompts
         For device or mounted virtual-device initialize:
             Device:  device-name
         For new virtual-device creation (INITIALIZE/CREATE):
             Filename:  file-name
2 Parameters

 device-name

      Specifies the name of the  device  on  which  the  volume  to  be
      initialized  is  physically  mounted.  The device must be mounted
      /FOREIGN.

      The device  name  can  also  refer  to  the  name  of  a  mounted
      virtual-device which is to be re-initialized.

 file-name

      For INITIALIZE/CREATE, the file-name refers to the name of a file
      which is to be created and initialized as a virtual device.
2 Description

      The EXCHANGE INITIALIZE command is used to erase all files from a
      volume.   After  initialization, the volume directory contains no
      files.  DOS-11 magnetic tapes and RT-11 block-addressable devices
      may be initialized.
2 Qualifiers
/ALLOCATION

 /ALLOCATION=n

      Specifies the allocation of a  new  virtual-device  file  as  the
      number  of 512-byte blocks specified as n.  If /ALLOCATION is not
      specified when creating a new virtual-device file, EXCHANGE  will
      default  to  an  allocation  of  494 blocks, the size of a single
      density floppy diskette.  The maximum allocation is 65536 blocks.

      A virtual-device file would normally be the size  of  a  standard
      device supported by both RT-11 and VMS.  These sizes are:

                     Device             Blocks

                     TU58               512
                     RX01               494
                     RX02               494 (single)
                                        988 (double)
                     RL02               20480  (?)
                     RK06               27126  (?)
                     RK07               53790

      The /ALLOCATION qualifier can also be used to reduce the size  of
      a physical device.  For example, if one wanted to prepare an RL02
      disk  but  only  had  an  RK07  available,  the  RK07  could   be
      initialized  to  a  volume of 20480 blocks.  Later, when the RL02
      was available, the files could be transferred to the RL02 without
      any  worry  about  whether  or  not they would fit on the smaller
      device.
/CREATE

      Says that a virtual device should be created and initialized,
      see help for  Virtual_Device for more  information on the use
      of virtual devices.
/DENSITY

 /DENSITY=density-value

      Specifies for magnetic tape volumes, the  density  in  bytes
      per inch (bpi) at which the tape is to be written.

      For tape volumes, the density value specified  can  be  800,
      1600  or  6250,  as  long as the density is supported by the
      tape drive.  If you do not specify a  density  value  for  a
      blank  tape, the system uses a default density of the lowest
      density supported by the tape drive.

      For the  RX02  dual-density  diskette  drive,  use  the  DCL
      command  $ INITIALIZE /DENSITY=SINGLE  or /DENSITY=DOUBLE to
      reformat the diskettes to a different density.  Then use the
      EXCHANGE  INITIALIZE  command  to create the RT-11 directory
      structure.

                               NOTE

         Floppy  diskettes  formatted  in  double  density
         cannot  be  read  or written by the console block
         storage device (an RX01 drive)  of  a  VAX-11/780
         until   they  have  been  reformatted  in  single
         density.
/EXTRA_WORDS

 /EXTRA_WORDS=n

      Specifies, for RT-11 volumes, the number of extra words to add to
      each  directory  entry,  in addition to the required seven words.
      This ability to increase  the  length  of  directory  entries  is
      useful  for  some RT-11 applications.  Increasing the size of the
      directory entries reduces the number of entries that fit in  each
      directory segment.

      Neither EXCHANGE nor the  RT-11  operating  system  provides  any
      means of accessing the extra directory information directly.
/MESSAGE

 /MESSAGE
 /NOMESSAGE

      The /MESSAGE qualifier  controls  whether  or  not  EXCHANGE
      prints a message which says that the volume was initialized.
      The default is determined by the /MESSAGE qualifier  on  the
      EXCHANGE verb when EXCHANGE was activated.
/SEGMENTS

 /SEGMENTS=n

      This qualifier defines, for RT-11 volumes, the number of  2-block
      directory  segments to allocate for the directory.  The number of
      segments in the directory establishes the number  of  files  that
      can  be  stored  on  a device.  The system allows a maximum of 72
      files per  directory  segment,  and  31  directory  segments  per
      device.   The  argument n represents the number of segments.  The
      valid range for n is from 1 to 31 (decimal).  The default  values
      for n depend on the device type, as per the following table:

                     Device             Segments

                     TU58               1
                     RX01               1
                     RX02               1 (single)
                                        4 (double)
                     RL02               16
                     RK06               16
                     RK07               31
/VOLUME_FORMAT

 /VOLUME_FORMAT=option

      The /VOLUME_FORMAT qualifier defines the physical format  of  the
      volume   to  be  processed.   The  default  format  qualifier  is
      dependent on the device type.  The default is /VOLUME_FORMAT=RT11
      for    block-addressable    devices    mounted    foreign,    and
      /VOLUME_FORMAT=DOS11 for magnetic tape devices  mounted  foreign.
      INITIALIZE is not valid for devices mounted native.

           Option                       Function

           RT11           Identifies   an   RT-11   formatted    block-
                          addressable volume
           DOS11          Identifies a DOS-11 formatted  magnetic  tape
                          volume

      See section 6.0 for a complete description of the  /VOLUME_FORMAT
      qualifier and the defaults.
2 Examples

      1.  $ MOUNT/FOREIGN  DLA2:
          %MOUNT-I-MOUNTED,                 mounted on DLA2:
          $ EXCHANGE
          EXCHANGE>  INITIALIZE   DLA2:
          %EXCHANGE-S-INITIALIZED, the RT-11 volume ATHENS$DLA2:
                          has been initialized

          The above command initializes the volume mounted on  the
          RL02  drive  ATHENS$DLA2:   Since  DLA2:   is  a  block-
          addressable  device  mounted  foreign,  /VOLUME=RT11  is
          defaulted.

      2.  EXCHANGE>  INITIALIZE   MTA0:/DENSITY=1600

          This command initializes the DOS-11 tape  volume  loaded
          on  MTA0:.  The density was specified as 1600 bpi, since
          the default would have been 800 bpi for an MT drive.
1 MOUNT
 Makes a foreign volume and the files or data it contains available for
 processing  by EXCHANGE.  The EXCHANGE MOUNT command enters the device
 into internal tables maintained by EXCHANGE.   Note  that  the  device
 must previously have been mounted on VMS with the DCL MOUNT command.

 Format
           EXCHANGE>  MOUNT   device-name
           EXCHANGE>  MOUNT /VIRTUAL   device-name   file-name

 Prompts
           For MOUNT /FOREIGN:
                 Device:  device-name
           For MOUNT /VIRTUAL:
                 Virtual device:  device-name
                 Filename:        file-name
2 Parameters

 device-name

      Specifies the physical device name or logical name of the  device
      on  which  the  volume is to be mounted.  For MOUNT /VIRTUAL, the
      device-name parameter supplies a name by which the virtual-device
      will be known.

 file-name

      For MOUNT /VIRTUAL only, the file-name parameter gives  the  name
      of the file containing the image of the foreign volume.
2 Description

      The EXCHANGE MOUNT command enters the description of the  foreign
      volume in internal tables maintained by EXCHANGE.  It is separate
      and distinct from the DCL MOUNT command, which enters the  device
      in  tables maintained by the VMS operating system.  A volume must
      also be mounted on VMS to be accessible to EXCHANGE.

      If another EXCHANGE command is  given  on  an  unmounted  foreign
      volume,   EXCHANGE   will   attempt   to   execute   an   implied
      MOUNT /FOREIGN /WRITE /NODATACHECK on the device.  In particular,
      this  feature  is  necessary  so that EXCHANGE can operate in the
      single command DCL mode.

      A  virtual  volume  must   be   explicitly   mounted   with   the
      MOUNT /VIRTUAL command.

      If a MOUNT /FOREIGN (either implied or explicit) command is given
      for  a  foreign  device  which  has  not  been mounted on the VMS
      system, EXCHANGE will issue the equivalent  of  the  DCL  command
      $ MOUNT /FOREIGN  and  attempt  to  make  the volume known to the
      operating system.  Any volume so mounted by  the  EXCHANGE  MOUNT
      command will remain mounted after EXCHANGE exits.

      When EXCHANGE issues this $ MOUNT /FOREIGN  command,  the  system
      checks:

        o  That the device has not been allocated to another user
        o  That a volume is physically loaded on the device specified
        o  For tapes, the volume accessibility field of the VOL1 label

      For more information on  managing  volumes  using  MOUNT  command
      qualifiers,  see  the  VAX/VMS  System  Management and Operations
      Guide.  Additional information on mounting is also  available  in
      the  VAX/VMS  Command  Language  User's Guide, the VAX/VMS System
      Services Reference Manual ($MOUNT system service) and the VAX/VMS
      Magnetic Tape User's Guide.
2 Qualifiers
/DATA_CHECK

 /DATA_CHECK=(READ,WRITE)
 /NODATA_CHECK

      The /DATA_CHECK qualifier determines whether EXCHANGE performs  a
      second  operation  after  every  I/O operation to verify that the
      data was correctly transferred.

      If /DATA_CHECK=WRITE is specified, after  every  write  operation
      EXCHANGE will reread the data just written and compare it against
      the original data.  If /DATA_CHECK=READ  is  specified,  EXCHANGE
      will  read  each  block  of data twice and verify that both reads
      received identical data.

      The /DATA_CHECK qualifier without any options  is  equivalent  to
      /DATA_CHECK=WRITE.

      It is usually more efficient to use the /DATA_CHECK option on the
      VMS  MOUNT  command  than to use the option on the EXCHANGE MOUNT
      command.     If    a    device    is     mounted     with     the
      $ MOUNT /FOREIGN /DATA_CHECK  command, VMS is able to use special
      features in the device hardware and device driver to perform  the
      redundant  I/O  operations.  The EXCHANGE data checks are done in
      the EXCHANGE software, which results in more overhead.

      The RX01 and RX02 floppy  diskette  drives  do  not  contain  the
      necessary  features  for  the  operating  system  to perform data
      checking.  If the  $ MOUNT /DATA_CHECK  command  is  given  on  a
      floppy,  the  system  is  not able to perform data checking, even
      though  no  warning  message  is  given.   EXCHANGE  is  able  to
      recognize, however, that a floppy was mounted with data checking.
      When it sees  this,  EXCHANGE  will  perform  the  software  data
      checking  inside  of  EXCHANGE  even  though  no  explicit  MOUNT
      /DATA_CHECK command was given to EXCHANGE.
/FOREIGN

      Indicates that the volume is not in the standard format  used  by
      the  VAX/VMS  operating system;  that is, a tape volume is not in
      the standard ANSI format, or a disk volume  is  not  in  Files-11
      format.

      The EXCHANGE MOUNT command will only mount foreign volumes.   The
      /FOREIGN  qualifier is the default.  Use the DCL command MOUNT to
      mount native volumes.

      The default protection applied to foreign volumes is RWLP  (Read,
      Write,  Logical  I/O, Physical I/O) for the system and owner.  If
      you mount a volume currently in Files-11 format with the /FOREIGN
      qualifier,  you  must  have the user privilege to override volume
      protection (VOLPRO), or your  UIC  must  match  the  UIC  on  the
      volume.
/MESSAGE

 /MESSAGE
 /NOMESSAGE

      The /MESSAGE qualifier  controls  whether  or  not  EXCHANGE
      prints  a message  which says  that the  volume was mounted.
      The default is determined by the /MESSAGE qualifier  on  the
      EXCHANGE verb when EXCHANGE was activated.
/VIRTUAL

      The /VIRTUAL qualifier is used to mount  a  Files-11  file  as  a
      virtual-device.   When  /VIRTUAL is used, the MOUNT command takes
      two parameters.  The first parameter is a device-name which  will
      be  assigned  as  the  name  of  the  virtual-device.  The second
      parameter is the name of the Files-11 file which is the image  of
      a foreign volume.

      See section 8 for more information on virtual-devices.
/VOLUME_FORMAT

 /VOLUME_FORMAT=option

      The /VOLUME_FORMAT qualifier defines the physical format  of  the
      volume   to  be  processed.   The  default  format  qualifier  is
      dependent on the device type.  The default is /VOLUME_FORMAT=RT11
      for    block-addressable    devices    mounted    foreign,    and
      /VOLUME_FORMAT=DOS11 for magnetic tape devices mounted foreign.

           Option                       Function

           RT11           Identifies   an   RT-11   formatted    block-
                          addressable volume
           DOS11          Identifies a DOS-11 formatted  magnetic  tape
                          volume

      See section 6.0 for a complete description of the  /VOLUME_FORMAT
      qualifier and the defaults.
/WRITE

 /WRITE
 /NOWRITE

      Controls whether the volume can be written.

      By default, a volume is considered read/write when it is mounted.
      You  can  specify /NOWRITE to provide read-only access to protect
      files.  It is equivalent to write-locking the device.

      If /WRITE is specified (either explicitly or by default) and  the
      volume  itself  is  write-locked,  EXCHANGE  will print a message
      explaining that the volume is write-locked.
2 Examples

      1.  EXCHANGE>  MOUNT   MT:
          %EXCHANGE-I-MOUNTED, MATH06 mounted on _MTA0:

          The MOUNT command requests that the  magnetic  tape  that  is
          loaded on the device MTA0 be mounted foreign.  The tape label
          is displayed, since the tape has been previously  initialized
          as  an  ANSI  labelled tape with the label MATH06.  This tape
          cannot be accessed as a Files-11 tape, presumably it will  be
          reinitialized  as  a  DOS-11 tape during the current EXCHANGE
          session.

      2.  EXCHANGE>  MOUNT   DMA1:
          %EXCHANGE-I-WRITELOCK, volume is write-locked
          %EXCHANGE-S-MOUNTED, volume DMA1:  mounted

          The command mounts the foreign volume spinning  in  the  RK07
          device  DMA1:,  making  it  available  to subsequent EXCHANGE
          commands.  EXCHANGE has recognized that the volume itself  is
          write-locked, and has printed a message.
1 RENAME
 Changes the file  specification  of  an  existing  file  on  a  block-
 addressable foreign volume.

 Format
         EXCHANGE>  RENAME   input-file-spec   output-file-spec

 Prompts
         From:  input-file-spec
         To:    output-file-spec
2 Parameters

 input-file-spec

      Specifies the names of one or more files whose specifications are
      to be changed.

      You can use wild card characters in the file name and  file  type
      specification.   In  this  case,  all  files whose specifications
      satisfy the fields that are specified are renamed.

 output-file-spec

      Provides the new file specification to be applied  to  the  input
      file.  The RENAME command uses the file name and file type of the
      input file specification to  provide  defaults  for  nonspecified
      fields in the output file.

      You can specify an asterisk (*) in place of the file name or file
      type  of the output-file-spec parameter;  the RENAME command uses
      the corresponding field in the input file specification  to  name
      the output file.  Wild card characters in corresponding fields of
      the input and output file specification result in multiple rename
      operations.

      The device name can be omitted  from  the  output  specification.
      EXCHANGE  will use the device name specified for the input, since
      it is impossible to rename a file from one device to another.
2 Qualifiers
/LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

      Controls  whether  the   RENAME   command   displays   the   file
      specification of each file that it renames.

      By default, the RENAME command does  not  display  the  names  of
      files after it renames them.
/SYSTEM

 /SYSTEM
 /NOSYSTEM

      Controls whether the EXCHANGE RENAME command renames files  which
      have a file extension of ".SYS".  These files are typically files
      which are necessary for the operation of an RT-11  system.   Only
      RT-11 volumes treat .SYS files in this special manner.

      By default, the RENAME command will not rename an RT-11 file with
      a  .SYS  extension,  whether  it is matched by a wildcard spec or
      explicitly named.  EXCHANGE will  print  a  message  whenever  it
      skips over a a .SYS file during a rename operation.

      EXCHANGE also treats files with ".BAD" extensions as special, but
      the /SYSTEM qualifier does not affect the operations against .BAD
      files.  To rename a .BAD file, specify the  filename  explicitly,
      rather  than  using  wildcards.  EXCHANGE does not warn that .BAD
      files are being skipped.
/VOLUME_FORMAT

 /VOLUME_FORMAT=option

      The /VOLUME_FORMAT qualifier defines the physical format  of  the
      volume  to  be  processed.   Currently RT-11 volumes are the only
      volumes on which RENAME is supported.

           Option                       Function

           RT11           Identifies   an   RT-11   formatted    block-
                          addressable volume

      See section 6.0 for a complete description of the  /VOLUME_FORMAT
      qualifier and the defaults.
2 Examples

      1.  EXCHANGE>  RENAME  DMA0:AVERAG.OBJ  MEAN

          The  RENAME  command  changes  the  file  name  of  the  file
          AVERAG.OBJ to MEAN.OBJ.

      2.  EXCHANGE>  RENAME   DLA2:*.TXT   *.OLD

          The RENAME command renames all files with file types  of  TXT
          to have file types of OLD.  The file names are not changed.

      3.  EXCHANGE>  RENAME/LOG   DMA0:DATA.*   NEW
          %EXCHANGE-I-RENAMED, _DMA0:DATA.AAA renamed to _DMA0:NEW.AAA
          %EXCHANGE-I-RENAMED, _DMA0:DATA.BBB renamed to _DMA0:NEW.BBB
          %EXCHANGE-I-RENAMED, _DMA0:DATA.CCC renamed to _DMA0:NEW.CCC

          Three files exist with the file name of  DATA.   This  RENAME
          command  illustrates  wild  card characters in the input file
          names.  The result is the renaming  of  all  three  files  as
          displayed by the /LOG qualifier.
1 SHOW
 Shows devices currently known to EXCHANGE.

 Format
         EXCHANGE>  SHOW
 Prompts
         None.
2 Description

      This command  shows  the  volumes  known  (mounted)  at  the
      current time, along with the attributes of the volumes.
2 Example

  1.   EXCHANGE> mount cs1:
       %EXCHANGE-S-MOUNTED, the RT-11 volume DELPHI$CSA1: has been mounted
       EXCHANGE> mount/virtual d: console
       %EXCHANGE-S-MOUNTVIR, the RT-11 virtual volume D: has been mounted
                 using the file CW:<BACKUP.SRC>CONSOLE.DSK;1
       EXCHANGE> show
       Mounted volumes:
        D:
               volume format:          RT-11
               volume class:           disk  (virtual volume)
               virtual file name:      CW:<BACKUP.SRC>CONSOLE.DSK;1
               volume size:            512 blocks
        DELPHI$CSA1:
               volume format:          RT-11
               volume class:           disk
               physical device name:   DELPHI$CSA1:
               volume size:            494 blocks
1 TYPE
 The EXCHANGE TYPE command displays the contents of a file or group  of
 files on the current output device.

 Format
         EXCHANGE>  TYPE   file-spec[,...]
 Prompts
         File:  file-spec[,...]
2 Parameters

 file-spec[,...]

      Specifies the names of one or more input files to be copied.   If
      you  specify more than one input file, you can separate them with
      either commas (,) or plus signs (+).  Standard VAX/VMS wild cards
      can  be specified in file names, both Files-11 and foreign.  Wild
      card directories are supported for Files-11 and DOS-11 input.

      The syntax for the file names  is  dependent  on  the  particular
      volume  format  option  present  or implied.  See Section 6.0 for
      descriptions of the volume format options.
2 Description

      The EXCHANGE TYPE command transfers a  file  or  files  from  the
      input volume to the current output device, SYS$OUTPUT.
2 Qualifiers
/LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

      Controls whether EXCHANGE TYPE displays the  file  specifications
      of each file printed.

      If you specify /LOG, the EXCHANGE TYPE command displays, for each
      copy  operation,  the file specifications of the input and output
      files and the number of blocks or  the number  of records  copied
      (depending  on  whether the file is copied on a block-by-block or
      record-by-record basis).
/RECORD_FORMAT

 /RECORD_FORMAT=(option[,...])

      The  /RECORD_FORMAT  qualifier  defines   the   internal   record
      structure of a file and other attributes of the records.

              Option                    Function

           BINARY         Identifies formatted binary mode transfers
           FIXED          Identifies fixed-length record format
           PHYSICAL       Identifies physical mode transfers
           STREAM         Identifies ASCII stream mode transfers
           LENGTH         Sets fixed-length record type and  determines
                          record size
           PAD            Sets the character to pad  short  records  on
                          fixed-length output

      See section 7.0 for a complete description of the  /RECORD_FORMAT
      qualifier and the defaults.
/REWIND

 /REWIND
 /NOREWIND

      Causes the input tape reel to be rewound (/REWIND) or not rewound
      (/NOREWIND) to beginning-of-tape before EXCHANGE searches for the
      file name specified in the input specifier.

      Use this  qualifier  only  for  magnetic  tapes.   The  /NOREWIND
      qualifier  is  the  default;   use  /REWIND when you want TYPE to
      start searching for a file at the beginning of  the  tape  rather
      than starting at the current position.
/VOLUME_FORMAT

 /VOLUME_FORMAT=option

      The /VOLUME_FORMAT qualifier defines the physical format  of  the
      volume   to  be  processed.   The  default  format  qualifier  is
      dependent on the device type.  The default is /VOLUME_FORMAT=RT11
      for    block-addressable    devices    mounted    foreign,    and
      /VOLUME_FORMAT=DOS11 for magnetic tape devices  mounted  foreign.
      The default for devices mounted native is /VOLUME_FORMAT=FILES11,
      the VAX/VMS native volume format.

           Option                       Function

           FILES11        Identifies a Files-11 formatted native volume
           RT11           Identifies   an   RT-11   formatted    block-
                          addressable volume
           DOS11          Identifies a DOS-11 formatted  magnetic  tape
                          volume

      A volume format qualifier determines the format of the file  name
      and  directory  specifications,  and  will  often  imply  certain
      defaults.  See section 6.0 for  a  complete  description  of  the
      /VOLUME_FORMAT qualifier and the defaults.
2 Examples

      1.  EXCHANGE> TYPE  TEST.DAT

          The TYPE command displays the contents of the  file  TEST.DAT
          from the default disk and directory.

      2.  EXCHANGE> TYPE  DYA0:BEAM.RAT/VOLUME=RT11/RECORD=STREAM

          This command copies the RT-11 file to the SYS$OUTPUT  device.
          The  two qualifiers are actually the defaults, assuming DYA0:
