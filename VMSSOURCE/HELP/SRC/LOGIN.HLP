1 LOGIN Procedure
  Initiates an interactive terminal session.

  Format:

    <CTRL/C> <CTRL/Y> <RETURN>
2 Command_Qualifiers

/CLI

 /CLI=command-language-interpreter

 Specifies the name of an alternate command language interpreter (CLI)
  to  override  the default CLI listed in the user authorization file.
  The CLI you specify must be located in SYS$SYSTEM and have the  file
  type EXE.

  Note that if you do not specify a command interpreter via  the  /CLI
  qualifier,  and  do  not  have  a  default  CLI  listed  in the user
  authorization file, the system will supply a default of /CLI=DCL.

/COMMAND

 /COMMAND[=file-spec]
 /NOCOMMAND

  Controls whether to execute your  default  login  command  procedure
  when  you log in.  Use the /COMMAND qualifier to specify the name of
  an alternate login command procedure.  If you specify  a  file  name
  without  a  file  type,  the  default file type COM is used.  If you
  specify /COMMAND and omit the file specification, your default login
  command procedure is executed.  By default, /COMMAND is assumed.

  Use the /NOCOMMAND qualifier if you do not want your  default  login
  command procedure to be executed.

/DISK

 /DISK=device-name[:]

 Specifies the name of a disk device to be associated with the logical
  device  SYS$DISK  for  the  terminal  session.   This  specification
  overrides  the  default   SYS$DISK   device   established   in   the
  authorization file.

/TABLES

 /TABLES=(command-table[,...])

 Specifies the name of an alternate CLI table to override the  default
  listed  in  the  user  authorization file (UAF).  This table name is
  considered a file specification.  The default device  and  directory
  is SYS$SHARE.  The default file type is EXE.

  If a logical name is used, the  table  name  specification  must  be
  defined in the system logical name table.

  If the /CLI qualifier is set to DCL or MCR,  the  /TABLES  qualifier
  defaults  to  the  correct  value.   If  the  /TABLES  qualifier  is
  specified without the /CLI  qualifier,  the  CLI  specified  in  the
  user's UAF will be used.

  The default is /TABLES=DCLTABLES.

2 Examples

  1.   <CTRL/Y>
       Username:  SMITHSON
       Password:

  CTRL/Y accesses the operating system, which immediately prompts  for
  a user name.  After validating the user name, the system prompts for
  the password but does not echo it.

  2.   <RETURN>
       Username:  HIGGINS/DISK=USER$
       Password:

       $ SHOW DEFAULT
         USER$:[HIGGINS]

  The /DISK qualifier requests that the default disk for the  terminal
  session  be DISK2.  The SHOW DEFAULT command shows that USER$ is the
  default disk.

  3.   <CTRL/C>
       Username: LIZA/CLI=MCR/COMMAND=ALTLOGIN.COM

       >

  The /CLI qualifier requests the alternate MCR  command  interpreter.
  The  right angle bracket indicates that MCR is active and expects an
  MCR command.   The  /COMMAND  qualifier  indicates  that  the  login
  command  file  ALTLOGIN.COM is to be executed instead of the default
  login command file.

  has  been  incorrectly  entered.   After  successfully logging in, a
  message showing  the  number  of  login  failures  since  your  last
  successful  login,  is displayed.  This message is only displayed if
  there has been one or more login failures.
