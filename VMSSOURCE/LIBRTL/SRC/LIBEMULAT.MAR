	.SBTTL	LIB$EMULATE - Dummy handler replacement for LIB$EMULATE
;++
; FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
;
;	This dummy condition handler, which only returns SS$_RESIGNAL, is
;	a replacement for the LIB$EMULATE floating-point emulation handler
;	which was supplied in VAX/VMS V3.0.  Since emulation of floating 
;	point instructions is now handled automatically by VAX/VMS, (see
;	[EMULAT.SRC]FPEMULATE.MAR), user programs no longer need to
;	establish LIB$EMULATE as a handler.  However, so that existing
;	programs will continue to link properly, this dummy handler replaces
;	LIB$EMULATE; it only returns SS$_RESIGNAL.  Since the SS$_OPCDEC
;	exception from missing floating instructions will never be seen
;	by user programs, this handler is a no-op.
;
;	Programs which reference LIB$EMULATE can now remove any such
;	references.
