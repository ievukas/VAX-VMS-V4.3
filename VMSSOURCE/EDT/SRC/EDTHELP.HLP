[7mDELETE[m
 
Deletes the character preceding the cursor and stores it in the delete character
buffer.  When the cursor is at the leftmost character position on a line, the
line terminator to the left is deleted and the text on that line is moved to the
right of the text in the line above.
3 300
[7mLINE - (0)[m
 
Moves the cursor forward or backward to the nearest beginning of a line,
depending on the current direction (see ADVANCE and BACKUP).
 
 
[7mOPEN LINE - (GOLD 0)[m
 
Breaks the current line into two lines.  The break is placed after the cursor
and leaves the cursor position unchanged.  Pressing the OPEN LINE key when the
cursor is at the beginning of a line creates a new blank line.
3 301
[7mWORD - (1)[m
Moves the cursor forward or backward by a word, depending on the current
direction (see ADVANCE and BACKUP).
 
[7mCHNGCASE - (GOLD 1)[m
Changes the case of a range of characters as follows:
 
    1.  If the select range is active, the case of each letter in the select
        range is changed.
    2.  If 1 does not apply and the cursor is positioned on the current search
        string, the case of each letter in the search string is changed.
        This does not apply if a repeat count greater than 1 is given.
    3.  If 1 and 2 do not apply, then the case of one letter is changed.
        If the current direction is ADVANCE, the cursor moves forward one
        character after the change of case occurs.  If the current direction is
        BACKUP, the cursor moves backward one character before the case change
        occurs.
3 302
[7mEOL - (2)[m
 
Moves the cursor forward or backward to the nearest end of line, depending on
current direction (see ADVANCE and BACKUP).
 
 
[7mDEL EOL - (GOLD 2)[m
 
Deletes all characters to the right of the cursor in the current line, including
the character on which the cursor is positioned, up to, but not including the
line terminator.
3 303
[7mCHAR - (3)[m
 
Moves the cursor forward or backward one character, depending on the current
direction (see ADVANCE and BACKUP).
 
 
[7mSPECINS - (GOLD 3)[m
 
Inserts any character from the DEC Multinational Character Set by using its
decimal value.  Press the GOLD key, enter the code for the character in decimal,

3 304
[7mADVANCE - (4)[m
 
Sets the current direction to forward for the CHAR, WORD, LINE, EOL, PAGE, SECT,
SUBS, FIND, and FNDNXT keys.  ADVANCE means that movement will be toward the end
of the buffer; that is, to the right and down.
 
 
[7mBOTTOM - (GOLD 4)[m
 
Positions the cursor at the end of the text buffer.
3 305
[7mBACKUP - (5)[m

beginning of the buffer; that is, to the left and up.
 
 
[7mTOP - (GOLD 5)[m
 
Positions the cursor at the beginning of the text buffer.
3 306
[7mCUT - (6)[m
 
Moves the select range to the PASTE buffer.  The select range is all the text
between the selected position (see SELECT) and the current cursor position.  If
no SELECT has been made and the cursor is positioned on the current search
string, that string is cut.  Each time CUT is used, the previous contents of the
PASTE buffer are discarded.
 
 
[7mPASTE - (GOLD 6)[m
 
Inserts the contents of the PASTE buffer directly to the left of the cursor.
3 307
[7mPAGE - (7)[m
 
Moves the cursor to the top of a page.  A page is defined by a delimiter string,
which can be set by the SET ENTITY command.  The default page delimiter is the
formfeed character (CTRL/L).
 
 
[7mCOMMAND - (GOLD 7)[m

keypad.
3 308
[7mSECT - (8)[m
 
Moves the cursor 16 lines (one section) forward or backward, depending on the
current direction (see ADVANCE and BACKUP).  The cursor is moved to the
beginning of the appropriate line.
 
 
[7mFILL - (GOLD 8)[m
 
Performs a word fill on the select range.  A word fill reformats a block of text
so that as many full words as possible are placed on each line without exceeding
the right margin.  You can set the right margin with the SET WRAP command.  If
it is not set, the default is the terminal width - 1.  For purposes of the FILL
command, only spaces are used as word delimiters.
3 309
[7mAPPEND - (9)[m
 
Moves the select range to the end of the PASTE buffer.  The select range is all
the text between the selected position (see SELECT) and the current cursor
position.  If no SELECT has been made and the cursor is positioned on the
current search string, that string is appended.
 
 
[7mREPLACE - (GOLD 9)[m
 
Deletes the select range and replaces it with the contents of the PASTE buffer.
3 310

the FIND key.  The direction of the search is the current one (ADVANCE or
BACKUP).
 
 
[7mFIND - (GOLD PF3)[m
 
Searches for an occurrence of a string.  Press the FIND key and then enter the
string using the main keyboard.  End the string by pressing either the ADVANCE
or BACKUP key to set the direction of the search, or the ENTER key to search in
the current direction.
3 312
[7mUP-ARROW[m
 
The ^ (up-arrow) key moves the cursor to the character above.
3 313
[7mDOWN-ARROW[m
 
The v (down-arrow) key moves the cursor to the character below.
3 314
[7mRIGHT-ARROW[m
 
The --> (right-arrow) key moves the cursor to the next character.
3 315
[7mLEFT-ARROW[m
 
The <-- (left-arrow) key moves the cursor to the preceding character.
3 316
[7mSELECT - (.)[m
 
Marks one end of a select range.  A select range is a block of text on which
various operations (such as CUT, APPEND, or FILL) can be performed.  To create a
select range:
 
    1.  Move the cursor to either the beginning or end of the text you
        wish to select.
    2.  Press the SELECT key.
    3.  Move the cursor to the opposite end of the text.
 
You can then perform the desired operation on the range.
 
 
[7mRESET - (GOLD .)[m
 
Cancels the effect of the GOLD key if it was pressed by mistake, cancels a
select range, or cancels any partly entered command string. Also sets the
current direction to forward.
3 317
[7mDEL L - (PF4)[m
 
Deletes text from the cursor position to the end of the current line, including
the line terminator.  If the cursor is positioned at the beginning of a line,
the entire line is deleted.  The deleted text is saved in the delete line
buffer.
 
 
[7mUND L - (GOLD PF4)[m
 
Inserts the contents of the delete line buffer directly to the left of the
cursor.
3 318
[7mDEL W - (-)[m
 
Deletes text from the cursor to the beginning of the next word, storing the text
in the delete word buffer.
 
 
[7mUND W - (GOLD -)[m
 
Inserts the contents of the delete word buffer directly to the left of the
cursor.
3 319
[7mDEL C - (,)[m
 
Deletes the character on which the cursor is positioned and saves it in the
delete character buffer.
 
 
[7mUND C - (GOLD ,)[m
 
Inserts the contents of the delete character buffer directly to the left of the
cursor.
3 320
[7mGOLD - (PF1)[m
 
Lets you use the lower (alternate) function of the editing keys. Press the GOLD
key, then the key you wish to use.
 
You can also use the GOLD key to enter counts.  Press GOLD and then the main
keyboard numeric keys, followed by the key to which the count should apply.
The DELETE key and CTRL/U can be used to edit the number, and thus cannot have
a count applied to them in this manner.  The SPECINS key treats the count as
the code for a character to be inserted.
 
The GOLD key is used with main keyboard keys for additional editing functions.
For help on "GOLD character" (for example, GOLD A), press the character's key on
the main keyboard.
3 321
[7mENTER[m
Sends information to EDT for functions such as FIND and COMMAND.
 
 
[7mSUBS - (GOLD ENTER)[m
Deletes the search string, replaces it with the contents of the PASTE buffer,
and finds the next occurrence of the string.  To use:
 
    1.  Press SELECT.
    2.  Type the new text.
    3.  Press CUT.
    4.  Press FIND.
    5.  Enter the text you wish to replace.
 
Each time you press SUBS, EDT makes one substitution and finds the next
occurrence of the search string.  You can use a repeat count for multiple
substitutions.

3 009
[7mTAB INSERT - (CTRL/I or TAB)[m
 
Moves the cursor in one of two ways:
 
    1.  If the tab size has not been set with SET TAB or if the cursor is not
        at the beginning of the line, a tab character is inserted at the cursor
        position.
 
    2.  If the tab size has been set with SET TAB or if the cursor is at the
        beginning of the line, a number of tab characters and spaces are
        inserted to move the cursor to the column position that is equal to
        the SET TAB value times the indentation level count.
3 010
[7mDELETE TO BEGINNING OF WORD - (CTRL/J or LINEFEED)[m

Inserts a carriage return/linefeed after the cursor and leaves the cursor
position unchanged.  Pressing the OPEN LINE key when the cursor is at the
beginning of the line creates a new blank line.
3 301
WORD  (1)
----
Moves the cursor forward or backward by a word, depending on the current
direction (see ADVANCE and BACKUP).
 
CHNGCASE  (GOLD 1)
--------
Changes the case of a range of characters as follows:
 
    1.  If the select range is active, the case of each letter in the select
        range is changed.
    2.  If 1 does not apply and the cursor is positioned on the current search
        string, the case of each letter in the search string is changed.
        This does not apply if a repeat count greater than 1 is given.
    3.  If 1 and 2 do not apply, then the case of one letter is changed.
        If the current direction is ADVANCE, the cursor moves forward one
        character after the change of case occurs.  If the current direction is
        BACKUP, the cursor moves backward one character before the case change
        occurs.
3 302
EOL  (2)
---
Moves the cursor forward or backward to the nearest end of line, depending on
the current direction (see ADVANCE and BACKUP).
 
 
DEL EOL  (GOLD 2)
-------
Deletes all characters to the right of the cursor in the current line, including
the character on which the cursor is positioned, up to, but not including the
line terminator.
3 303
CUT  (3)
---
Moves the select range to the PASTE buffer. The select range is all the text
between the selected position (see SELECT) and the current cursor position.  If
no SELECT has been made and the cursor is positioned on the current search
string, that string is cut.  Each time CUT is used, the previous contents of the
PASTE buffer are discarded.
 
 
PASTE  (GOLD 3)
-----
Inserts the contents of the PASTE buffer directly to the left of the cursor.
3 304
ADVANCE  (4)

SUBS, FIND, and FNDNXT keys.  ADVANCE means that movement will be toward the end
of the buffer; that is, to the right and down.
 
 
BOTTOM  (GOLD 4)
------
Positions the cursor at the end of the text buffer.
3 305
BACKUP  (5)
------
Sets the cursor direction to backward for the CHAR, WORD, LINE, EOL, PAGE, SECT,
SUBS, FIND, and FNDNXT keys.  BACKUP means that movement will be toward the
beginning of the buffer; that is, to the left and up.

Allows you to enter a line mode command to be executed without exiting from
keypad mode.  The command is processed when you press the ENTER key on the
keypad.
 
3 308
FNDNXT  (8)
------
Searches for the next occurrence of the search string previously entered with
the FIND key.  The direction of the search is the current one (ADVANCE or
BACKUP).
 
 
FIND  (GOLD 8)
----
Searches for an occurrence of a string.  Press the FIND key and then enter the
string using the main keyboard.  End the string by pressing either the ADVANCE
or BACKUP key to set the direction of the search, or the ENTER key to search in
the current direction.
3 309
DEL W  (9)
-----
Deletes text from the cursor to the beginning of the next word, storing the text
in the delete word buffer.
 
 
UND W  (GOLD 9)
-----
Inserts the contents of the delete word buffer directly to the left of the
cursor.
3 310
HELP  (RED)
----
Use the HELP key to obtain help on the editing keypad.
3 311
DEL L  (GRAY)
-----

-----
The --> (right-arrow) key moves the cursor to the next character.
 
 
SPECINS  (GOLD RIGHT-ARROW)
-------
Inserts any character from the DEC Multinational Character Set by using its
decimal value.  Press the GOLD key, enter the code for the character in decimal,
press the GOLD key again, and press SPECINS (special insert).
3 315
LEFT  (LEFT-ARROW)
----
The <-- (left-arrow) key moves the cursor to the preceding character.
 
 
APPEND  (GOLD LEFT-ARROW)
------
Moves the select range to the end of the PASTE buffer.  The select range is all
the text between the selected position (see SELECT) and the current cursor
position.  If no SELECT has been made and the cursor is positioned on the
current search string, that string is appended.
3 316
SELECT  (.)
------
Marks one end of a select range.  A select range is a block of text on which
various operations (such as CUT, APPEND, or FILL) can be performed.  To create a
select range:
 
    1.  Move the cursor to either the beginning or end of the text you wish to
        select.
    2.  Press the SELECT key.
    3.  Move the cursor to the opposite end of the text.
 
You can then perform the desired operation on the range.
 
 
RESET  (GOLD .)
-----
Cancels the effect of the GOLD key if it was pressed by mistake, cancels a
select range, or cancels any partly entered command string.  Also sets the
current direction to forward.
3 320
GOLD  (BLUE)
----
Lets you use the lower (alternate) function of the editing keys. Press the GOLD
key, then the key you wish to use.
 
You can also use the GOLD key to enter counts.  Press GOLD and then the main
keyboard numeric keys, followed by the key to which the count should apply.
The DELETE key and CTRL/U can be used to edit the number, and thus cannot have
a count applied to them in this manner.  The SPECINS key treats the count as
the code for a character to be inserted.
 
The GOLD key is used with main keyboard keys for additional editing functions.
For help on "GOLD character" (for example, GOLD A), press the character's key on
the main keyboard.
3 321
ENTER
-----
Sends information to EDT for functions such as FIND and COMMAND.
 
SUBS  (GOLD ENTER)
----
Deletes the search string, replaces it with the contents of the PASTE buffer,
and finds the next occurrence of the string.  To use:
 
    1.  Press SELECT.
    2.  Type the new text.
    3.  Press CUT.
    4.  Press FIND.
    5.  Enter the text you wish to replace.
 
Each time you press SUBS, EDT makes one substitution and finds the next
occurrence of the search string.  You can use a repeat count for multiple
substitutions.
3 001
TAB COMPUTE  (CTRL/A)
-----------
Sets the indentation level count to the value obtained from dividing the current
cursor column position by the SET TAB number.  If the cursor position is not a
multiple of the SET TAB number, an error results.  You must have a SET TAB in
effect to use CTRL/A.
3 004
TAB DECREASE  (CTRL/D)
------------
Used to decrease the indentation level counter.  You must have a SET TAB in
effect to use CTRL/D.
3 005
TAB INCREASE  (CTRL/E)
------------
Used to increase the indentation level counter.  You must have a SET TAB in
effect to use CTRL/E.
3 006
FILL  (CTRL/F)
----
Performs a word fill on the select range.  A word fill reformats a block of text
so that as many full words as possible are placed on each line without exceeding
the right margin.  You can set the right margin with the SET WRAP command.  If
it is not set, the default is the terminal width - 1.  For purposes of the FILL
command, only spaces are used as word delimiters.
3 008
BEGINNING OF LINE  (CTRL/H or BACKSPACE)
-----------------
Moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line.  If the cursor is already
at the beginning of a line, it moves to the beginning of the previous line.
3 009
TAB INSERT  (CTRL/I or TAB)
----------
Moves the cursor in one of two ways:
 
    1.  If the tab size has not been set with SET TAB or if the cursor is not at
        the beginning of the line, a tab character is inserted at the cursor
        position.
    2.  If the tab size has been set with SET TAB or if the cursor is at the
        beginning of the line, a number of tab characters and spaces are
        inserted to move the cursor to the column position that is equal to the
        SET TAB value times the indentation level count.
3 010
DELETE TO BEGINNING OF LINE  (CTRL/J or LINEFEED)
---------------------------
Used to delete all characters from the cursor position to the beginning of the
word containing the cursor.  If the cursor is on the first character of a word
the previous word is deleted.
3 011
DEFINE KEY   (CTRL/K)
----------
Used to define a new keypad function for an editing key.  You are prompted first
to press the key to be defined, then to enter the definition.  You can define
the key either in terms of other editing keys or with nokeypad mode commands.
If you press an editing key, its definition appears at the bottom of the screen
in the definition line.
3 012
INSERT FORMFEED   (CTRL/L)
----------------
Inserts a formfeed character (<FF>) at the cursor position.
3 018
REFRESH   (CTRL/R)
-------
Refreshes the screen display.  The screen becomes blank and then the characters
in the buffer reappear, minus extraneous characters, such as system messages.
The cursor remains in the same location.
3 020
TAB ADJUST  (CTRL/T)
----------
Indents the select range.  To use the key:
 
    1.  Create a select range of the text you wish to adjust.
    2.  Enter a level count using the GOLD key.  To decrease the tab
        indentation level, precede the count with a minus sign.  The default
        level count is 1.
    3.  Use the tab adjust key.
 
The effect of CTRL/T is to increase or decrease the indentation level of the
select range by the number of tabs indicated by the level count.  You must have
a SET TAB value in effect to use CTRL/T.
3 021
DELETE TO BEGINNING OF LINE  (CTRL/U)
---------------------------
Used to delete all characters in the current line to the left of the cursor.  If
the cursor is on the first character of a line, the entire previous line is
deleted.
3 023
REFRESH   (CTRL/W)
-------
Refreshes the screen display.  The screen becomes blank and then the characters
in the buffer reappear, minus extraneous characters, such as system messages.
The cursor remains in the same location.
3 026
EXIT  (CTRL/Z)
----
Shifts EDT to line editing.
 
3 065
TAB COMPUTE  (GOLD A)
-----------
Sets the indentation level count to the value obtained from dividing the
current cursor column position by the SET TAB number.  If the cursor position
is not a multiple of the SET TAB number, an error results.  You must have a SET
TAB value in effect to use GOLD A.
3 068

------------
Used to increase the indentation level counter.  You must have a SET TAB value
in effect to use GOLD E.
3 070
FILL  (GOLD F)
----
Performs a word fill on the select range.  A word fill reformats a block of text
so that as many full words as possible are placed on each line without exceeding
the right margin.  The right margin can be set by the SET WRAP command.  If it
is not set, the default is the terminal width - 1.  For purposes of the FILL
command, only spaces are used as word delimiters.
3 082
REFRESH   (GOLD R)
-------
Refreshes the screen display.  The screen becomes blank and then the characters
in the buffer reappear, minus extraneous characters, such as system messages.
The cursor remains in the same location.
3 084
TAB ADJUST  (GOLD T)
----------
Adjusts the tab level of the select range.  The key is used as follows:
 
    1.  Create a select range of the text you wish to adjust.
    2.  Enter a level count using the GOLD key.  To decrease the tab
        indentation level, precede the count with a minus sign.  The default
        level count is 1.
    3.  Use the tab adjust key.
 
The effect of GOLD T is to increase or decrease the indentation level of the
select range by the number of tabs indicated by the level count.  You must have
a SET TAB value in effect to use GOLD T.
3 085
DELETE TO BEGINNING OF LINE  (GOLD U)
---------------------------
Used to delete all characters in the current line to the left of the cursor.  If
the cursor is on the first character of a line, the entire previous line is
deleted.
3 087
REFRESH   (GOLD W)
-------
Refreshes the screen display.  The screen becomes blank and then the characters
in the buffer reappear, minus extraneous characters, such as system messages.
The cursor remains in the same location.
3 090
EXIT  (GOLD Z)
----
Shifts EDT to line editing.
 
1 CHANGE
The CHANGE command puts EDT in change mode.  Use change mode to edit at
the character level rather than the line level.
 
Format: CHANGE [range] [;nokeypad command(s)]
 
The optional range specifies the cursor position when you enter change
mode.  If you omit range, the current position is used.
 
There are three submodes of change mode.  Which submode you use depends
on the type of terminal you are using and whether or not you wish to use
the auxiliary (numeric) keypad for editing commands.  These modes are:
 
    1.  Hardcopy mode
    2.  Keypad mode
    3.  Nokeypad mode
 
If the CHANGE command contains a semicolon (;) it may be followed by
nokeypad commands.  If the last nokeypad command is EX, EDT returns to
line mode for the next command line.  This is the only form of the
CHANGE command that may be used in a startup command file or macro.
2 ENTITIES
Entities are used in nokeypad mode commands to specify the text on
which a command will operate.  Each entity represents a portion of
text, which may be anything from a single character to an entire text
buffer.  Most entities can be preceded by a count, which indicates the
number of entities to be affected.
3 CHARACTER
The character entity is specified by the letter C.  It selects a single
character of text.
3 WORD
A word consists of a string of characters terminated by a set of
delimiter characters.  The default delimiter characters are spaces,
tabs, carriage returns, line terminators, line feeds, formfeeds, and
vertical tabs. Spaces are handled in a special way:  all spaces
following a word up to the first non-space character are considered part
of a word.  Other delimiters are not considered  part of the word they
terminate.  Rather, they are considered to be words by themselves,
unless SET WORD NODELIMITER in in effect. If SET WORD NODELIMTER is in
effect, delimiters are not considered words by themselves but are
considered part of the word they terminate. The three word entities are:
 
    W   Specifies the entire word in which the cursor is positioned.
    BW  Specifies all characters preceding the cursor up to the beginning
        of the word.
    EW  Specifies all characters from the cursor through the end of the
        word.
 
You can change the word delimiters with the SET ENTITY command.
3 LINE
The line entities are:
 
    L   Specifies the entire line in which the cursor is positioned.
    BL  Specifies all characters preceding the cursor up to the beginning
        of a line.  (When the cursor is positioned at the beginning of a
        line, the BL entity selects the entire previous line.)
    EL  Specifies all characters from the cursor to the end of a line,
        including the character on which the cursor is positioned.
        (If the cursor is on a line terminator, the entire next line is
        selected.)
    NL  Specifies all characters from the cursor to the beginning of the
        next line, including the character on which the cursor is
        positioned.
3 RANGE
The range entities specify all text in the buffer either before or after
the cursor.  The two range entities are:
 
    BR  Specifies the text from the cursor position to the beginning of
        the buffer.
    ER  Specifies the text from the cursor position to the end of the
        buffer.
3 SENTENCE
A sentence consists of a string of characters terminated by one of a set
of single character delimiters.  The default sentence delimiters are:
period (.), question mark (?), and exclamation point (!).  A sentence
delimiter is considered to be a delimiter only if it is at the end of a
line or if it is followed by a space.  The line terminator or trailing
spaces are considered a part of the sentence.  There are three sentence
entities:
 
    SEN   Specifies the entire sentence in which the cursor is positioned,
          including the delimiter and trailing spaces or line terminator.
    BSEN  Specifies all characters preceding the cursor in the current
          sentence.
    ESEN  Specifies all characters in the current sentence from the cursor
          to (but not including) the delimiter character.
 
The sentence delimiters can be changed by the SET ENTITY command.
3 PAGE
A page consists of all the text between two page delimiters, including
the trailing page delimiter.  The default page delimiter is the formfeed
character. The three page entities are:
 
    PAGE  Specifies all of the current page.
    BPAGE Specifies all characters in the current page from the character
          preceding the cursor to the beginning of the page.
    EPAGE Specifies all characters in the current page from the cursor to
          (but not including) the page delimiter.
 
You can change the page delimiter with the SET ENTITY command.
3 PARAGRAPH
A paragraph consists of all the text between two paragraph delimiters,
including the trailing paragraph delimiter, and if SET PARAGRAPH WPS is
in effect, any adjacent delimiters. The default paragraph delimiter is
two consecutive line terminators. The three paragraph entities are:
 
    PAR   Specifies all of the current paragraph.
    BPAR  Specifies all characters in the current paragraph from the
          character preceding the cursor to the beginning of the paragraph.
    EPAR  Specifies all characters in the current paragraph from the cursor
          to (but not including) the paragraph delimiter.
 
You can change the paragraph delimiter with the SET ENTITY command.
3 SELECT
The select entity consists of all characters between the cursor and the
select mark.  The select mark must have been specified previously by a
SEL command.  The select range entity is specified by SR.  Some commands
use the search string when the SR entity is specified but no select
range has been created.
3 VERTICAL
The vertical entity is the same as the line entity, except that with the
V entity, the cursor stays in the same column.  You specify the vertical
entity with V.
3 STRING
The string entity consists of all the characters between the cursor and
the next occurrence of a specified search string.  Specify the string
entity by enclosing the desired search string in single or double
quotation marks. If the string is null (specified by '' or ""), the
previous search string is used again.
 
For key definitions, you may use the null character (character code 0)
in place of the quotation marks to avoid conflicts with the search
string.
2 HARDCOPY
On a hardcopy terminal, change mode operates this way:
 
When you enter change mode, EDT displays the current line on the
terminal. The cursor position is marked by bracketing the character on
which the cursor is positioned.  EDT will then prompt with the
characters:
 
    C*
 
In response, you type a series of nokeypad mode commands terminated by
pressing return.  EDT will execute the commands and type the current
line.
2 KEYPAD
You enter the keypad mode of change mode when your terminal is a
VT100-type or VT52 and the keypad option is set.  (This option is set by
default for these terminals.)  In this mode the terminal screen is used
to view the text buffer.  Characters typed using the main keyboard are
inserted into the buffer at the cursor position.  You enter editing
commands by using keys on the auxiliary keypad, function keys, or
control keys on the main keyboard.
 
For more help on keypad mode, type CHANGE to enter that mode.  Use the
keypad HELP facility as follows:
 
    1.  If your terminal is a VT100-type, press the keypad key marked PF2.
    2.  If your terminal is a VT52, press the red keypad key.
    3.  If your terminal has function keys, press the function key marked
        HELP.
2 NOKEYPAD
You enter the nokeypad mode of change mode if your terminal is a
VT100-type or VT52 and the SET NOKEYPAD command has been used to turn
off the keypad option.  The screen is used as a window into the text
buffer. You type nokeypad mode commands at the keyboard; they echo on
the bottom line of the screen.  EDT executes the commands and updates
the text on the screen whenever you press return.
2 SUBCOMMANDS
When EDT is in change mode and SET NOKEYPAD is in effect or your
terminal is set to HARDCOPY, EDT accepts a distinct set of commands
called the nokeypad mode commands.  You may concatenate a string of
these commands with or without spaces separating them.
 
Nokeypad commands take one of the following forms, depending on the
particular command:
 
    1.  command
    2.  [+|-][count]command
    3.  [+|-][count][command][+|-][count][+|-]entity[=buffer]
 
Whenever a sign can appear in more than one place, the last sign
specified determines the direction.
3 ADV
The ADV (advance) command sets the cursor direction to advance.  Many
nokeypad commands use the current direction to determine whether
entities to the left or to the right of the cursor are to be affected.
When the direction is forward, nokeypad commands affect the cursor
character and characters to the right.
 
Format: ADV
3 APPEND
The APPEND command works in the same way as the CUT command (see CUT)
except that it adds the new text to the end of the alternate buffer
instead of replacing its contents.
 
Format: [+|-][count]APPEND[+|-][count][+|-]entity[=buffer]
3 ASC
The ASC nokeypad command inserts a specified character into the buffer
at the cursor position.  Use the count field to indicate the decimal
code of the character you want to insert.  Characters are coded using
the DEC Multinational Character Set; codes 0 to 127 are the same as
ASCII.
 
Format: [count]ASC
 
The ASC command is the only way to insert a carriage return into the
middle of a line of text; otherwise, insert commands always treat the
carriage return as a line terminator.  The following command would
insert a carriage return:
 
    13ASC   (13 is the code for carriage return)
3 BACK
The BACK command sets the cursor direction to backward.  Many nokeypad
commands use the current direction to determine whether entities to the
left or to the right of the cursor are to be affected.  When the
direction is backward, nokeypad commands affect characters to the left
of the cursor.
 
Format: BACK
3 BELL
The BELL command rings the bell on the terminal.  There is no effect on
the text buffer.
 
Format: BELL
3 CHGC
The CHGC command changes the case of every letter in the specified
number of entities: lowercase letters become uppercase and uppercase
become lowercase.
 
Format: [+|-][count]CHGC[+|-][count][+|-]entity
 
CHGCSR (change case of select region) works differently:  If there is no
select range and the cursor is in the search string, CHGCSR changes the
case of every letter in the search string.  If there is no select range
and the cursor is not in the search string, CHGCSR changes the case of
the character under the cursor, if it is letter.  If the [count] field
is two or more, CHGCSR ignores the search string condition.
3 CHGL
The CHGL command forces every letter in the specified range to
lowercase.
 
Format: [+|-][count]CHGL[+|-][count][+|-]entity
 
CHGLSR has the same special contingencies as CHGCSR.
3 CHGU
The CHGU command forces every letter in the specified range to
uppercase.
 
Format: [+|-][count]CHGU[+|-][count][+|-]entity
 
CHGUSR has the same special contingencies as CHGCSR.
3 CLSS
The CLSS command clears the search string buffer.
Format: CLSS
3 CUT
The CUT command deletes a specified number of entities and saves all the
deleted text in an alternate text buffer.  The command works exactly
like the DELETE command except that the text is saved.
 
Format: [+|-][count]CUT[+|-][count][+|-]entity[=buffer]
 
If you do not specify a buffer, the buffer named PASTE is used.
 
Ex: CUTSR   Cut the selected range
    CUTPAGE Cut the current page of text
3 D
The D nokeypad command deletes a specified number of entities.
 
Format: [+|-][count]D[+|-][count][+|-]entity
 
If the entity is C, W, BW, EW, L, BL, EL, or NL, the last entity deleted
by the command is saved in the delete buffer associated with the entity
and can be restored with the UNDC, UNDW, or UNDL nokeypad command.
 
Ex: D15C    Deletes 15 characters in the current direction.
    DSR     Deletes the select range.
    DBR     Deletes to the beginning of the buffer.
3 DATE
The DATE command inserts the current date and time string into the
buffer at the current cursor position.
 
The form of the string is:  dd-MMM-yyyy hh:mm:ss .  Note the trailing
space.  Before the tenth of the month the dd is a space followed by a
single digit.  If you prefer the month abbreviation to be in lower case,
you can change it by backing up to the month and using CHGL.  This
command always uses the English abbreviations for month names.
 
Format: DATE
3 DEFK
The DEFK command can be used to reassign the define key function to
another redefinable keypad mode function key.
Format: DEFK
3 DESEL
The DESEL command cancels the current select range if one is active.  If
no select range is active the command has no effect.
 
Format: DESEL
3 DLWC
The DLWC (default lowercase) command sets the motion state to lowercase.
With this as the motion state moving the cursor over a lower case letter
changes it to upper case.  See DUPC and DMOV.
 
Format: DLWC
3 DMOV
The DMOV command returns the default motion state to unchanged.  With
this as the motion state moving the cursor over a letter does not change
its case.  See DLWC and DUPC.
 
Format: DMOV
3 DUPC
The DUPC (default uppercase) command sets the motion state to uppercase.
With this as the motion state moving the cursor over a lower case letter
changes it to upper case.  See DMOV and DLWC.
 
Format: DUPC
3 EX
The EX (exit) command exits from change mode to line mode.
 
Format: EX
3 EXT
The EXT (extend) command executes a line mode command while you are in
change mode.  EDT interprets the remainder of the command line as a line
mode command, executes the command, and reenters change mode
automatically. The EXT command may not be used inside parentheses.
 
Format: EXT line mode command
3 FILL
The FILL command reformats a block of text so that as many complete
words as possible are placed on each line without exceeding the right
margin.  It sets the right margin to the terminal width minus 1
character by default.  The margin can be changed by the SET WRAP
command.
 
Format: [+|-][count]FILL[+|-][count][+|-]entity
3 HELP
The HELP command can be used to reassign the help function to another
redefinable keypad mode function key.
3 I
The I command inserts new text into the buffer at the current cursor
position.
 
Format: Itext to be inserted^Z
    or: I
	text to be inserted
	^Z
 
If you plan to insert only a few characters, use the first form of the I
command.  If you plan to insert several lines use the second form.  With
the second form you can insert lines until you type control Z.  On
VT100-type terminals the I command remains at the bottom of the screen
to remind you that you are inserting text.  Only the first form of the I
command can be used in a key definition or after C; in a macro or
startup command file.
 
3 KS
The KS command modifies the cursor position after a PASTE command.
 
After a PASTE command, the cursor is on the character to the right of
the pasted text.  If PASTE is followed by KS, however, the cursor moves
to the last pasted character if the current direction is forward and to
the first pasted character if the direction is backward.  You should
only use the KS command immediately after a PASTE command.
 
Format: PASTE KS
 
Such cursor positioning affects a subsequent string search.  KS is used
in the definition of the keypad SUBS function so that the character that
follows the pasted text in the current direction is included in the next
string search.
3 MOVE
The "MOVE" command moves the cursor a specified number of entities. If
DLWC is in effect, all letters encountered are forced to lowercase. If
DUPC is in effect, all letters encountered are forced to uppercase. If
DMOV is in effect, no text is changed.  The "MOVE" command uses no
command word.
 
Format: [+|-][count][+|-]entity
 
If you use an explicit sign, the direction of the move is determined by
that sign (+ for forward, - for backward); otherwise, the current
direction mode (set by the ADV or BACK command) is used to determine the
direction.
 
Ex: +3W     Moves the cursor 3 words forward.
    L       Moves the cursor 1 line in the current direction.
    -PAGE   Moves the cursor backward to a page delimiter.
3 PASTE
The PASTE command copies the contents of an alternate buffer into the
current buffer at the cursor position.
 
Format: [count]PASTE[=buffer]
 
If you omit the buffer name, the PASTE buffer is used.
3 QUIT
The QUIT nokeypad command leaves the editor without saving any text buffers.
This will cause you to lose any editing you have done in this session
unless you used the WRITE command to save the text before quitting.
 
Format: QUIT
3 R
The R (replace) command deletes the specified entities and leaves you in
the insert state so you can enter the text that you want to replace the
deleted text with.
 
Format: [+|-][count]R[+|-][count][+|-]entity
3 REF
The REF command refreshes the screen.
 
Format: REF
3 S
The S command replaces occurrences of one string of characters with
another.
 
Format: [+|-][count]S/string-1/string-2/
 
The slashes represent any non-alphanumeric character used to delimit the
two strings.  S searches in the specified direction from the cursor and
finds an occurrence of string-1.  It deletes string-1 and inserts
string-2 in its place.
 
Ex: S/1988/1989/
3 SEL
The SEL command marks a portion of text that will be one end of a select
range. You create a select range by positioning to one end of the
desired text (either end will do), executing the SEL command, moving to
the other end of the desired text, and performing an operation on the SR
(select range) entity.  On VT100-type terminals the select range is
displayed in reverse video.
 
Format: SEL
3 SHIFT
Use the SHL (shift left) and SHR (shift right) commands to alter the
left margin when in change mode.  The left margin is the position of the
first character in each line on the screen.  Normally, the left margin
is 0, which means all characters are displayed.  If you use a SHL
command, the left margin can be changed by an integral number of tab
stops (8 characters).  If SHL is used once, the first 8 columns will not
be displayed on the screen.  This shifts the screen window horizontally.
 
Format: countSHL  (Shift left by count tab stops)
        countSHR  (Shift right by count tab stops)
3 SSEL
The SSEL (search and select) command searches for the occurrence of a
string and places the string in the select range.  The cursor remains at
the far end of the string.
 
Format: SSEL"string"
3 SN
The SN (substitute next) command performs a substitution using the same
search and replacement strings as the previous substitute command.
 
Format: [+|-][count]SN
3 TAB
Use the TAB nokeypad command when the line mode SET TAB command is in
effect.  The TAB command inserts the correct number of tabs and blanks
to position the cursor to the current tab level.  When SET NOTAB is in
effect, or when the cursor is not at the beginning of a line, this
command inserts an HT character, thus positioning the cursor to the next
tab stop.  Tab stops are every eight columns.
 
Format: TAB
3 TADJ
The TADJ command adjusts the tab level for the specified range of text.
The SET TAB value determines the tab size. The tab level is adjusted by
the value of count; it is incremented for a positive count and
decremented for a negative count.  A count not preceded by + or - is
assumed positive.  The TADJ tab setting is the product of the tab size
and the count.
 
Format: [+|-][count]TADJ[+|-][count]entity
 
Note that the + or - that precedes the first count is not used to modify
the direction of entity selection.  Its function in this command differs
in this way from all other nokeypad commands that use a similar format.
3 TC
The TC nokeypad command computes the tab level from the current cursor
position.  This command has meaning only if SET TAB is in effect.
 
Format: TC
3 TD
The TD nokeypad command decreases the tab level count.  This command has
meaning only if SET TAB is in effect.
 
Format: TD
3 TGSEL
The TGSEL command allows you to toggle select.  When the select range is
active, TGSEL will cancel it, and when no select range is active, TGSEL
will enable it, acting like the SEL command.
 
Format: TGSEL
3 TI
The TI nokeypad command increases the tab level counter.  This command
has meaning only if SET TAB is in effect.
 
Format: TI
3 TOP
The TOP command forces the line on which the cursor is positioned to the
top of the screen.  If there is less than a full screen of lines between
the current line and the end of the buffer, TOP has no effect. 
 
Format: TOP
3 UNDELETE
The UNDELETE commands restore the last entity deleted by a delete
command.
 
Format: UNDC  (undelete character)
        UNDW  (undelete word)
        UNDL  (undelete line)
3 XLATE
The XLATE command allows calling back to the caller of callable EDT.
 
Format: XLATEtext^Z
 
The text is passed to the XLATE routine, which returns some NOKEYPAD
commands for EDT to execute.  This command is an error except on VAX/VMS
when EDT is being called from a program.  See the EDT Editor Manual for
more details.
3 ()
A sequence of nokeypad commands can also be enclosed in parentheses to
form a single unit.  A number preceding the left parenthesis indicates
the number of times to repeat the entire sequence.  The EXT nokeypad
command cannot appear inside parentheses.
3 ^
This command provides for the insertion of control characters in text.
EDT accepts a circumflex (^) followed by a letter from A to Z, an @, [,
\, ], ^ or _.  Each of these 32 characters is transformed into a control
character by subtracting 32 from its ASCII code, thus ^@ becomes NUL, ^A
becomes SOH, etc.
 
Format: [count]^[character]
1 CLEAR
The CLEAR (abbreviated CL) command deletes a buffer.
 
Format: CLEAR buffer
 
The buffer no longer appears on the list printed by SHOW BUFFER.  If the
buffer was a macro, it is no longer a macro.  If the buffer contained any
text, that text is deleted.  If that buffer was the current buffer, the
current buffer becomes MAIN.  There are two exceptions to these rules: the
buffers PASTE and MAIN.  The CLEAR command does not delete these buffers but
just deletes their text.  Note that the argument is a buffer name, not a range
specification:  CLEAR PASTE is valid, while CLEAR =PASTE and CLEAR BUFFER
PASTE are not.
1 COPY
The COPY (abbreviated CO) command copies text from one location to
another within a buffer or between buffers.  When text is copied, the
source text remains intact.
 
Format: COPY [range-1] TO [range-2] [/QUERY] [/DUPLICATE:n]
 
The lines specified by range-1 are copied above the first line specified
by range-2.  Either range defaults to the current line. Either range may
include a buffer specification.
 
If the destination is not the current buffer, put the name of the
receiving buffer immediately after TO (=buffer). Give the full name of
the buffer.  To copy text from an external file, see INCLUDE.
2 /DUPLICATE
Format: /DUPLICATE:n
 
When you use the /DUPLICATE (abbreviated /DUP) qualifier, the lines
specified by range-1 are duplicated n times.
2 /QUERY
Format: /QUERY
 
When you use the /QUERY (abbreviated /Q) qualifier, EDT prompts you with
a question mark (?) to verify each line to be copied.
 
Responses are:
 
    Y   Yes, copy this line
    N   No, do not copy this line
    Q   Quit, do not copy any of the remaining lines in the range
    A   All, copy all the rest of the lines
1 DEFINE
The DEFINE command (abbreviated DEF) defines either editing keys for
keypad mode or macros for line mode.
2 KEY
The DEFINE KEY (abbreviated DEF K) command creates definitions for
editing keys for use in keypad mode.  You can redefine keypad keys,
control key sequences and GOLD control key sequences.  You can also
define function keys, for terminals that have them.
 
Format: DEFINE KEY key-name AS 'string'
3 KEY-NAME
Format: DEFINE KEY key-name AS 'string'
 
Key-name is one of the following:
 
    [GOLD] [FUNCTION] number
    [GOLD] CONTROL character
    [GOLD] CONTROL "character"
    [GOLD] CONTROL 'character'
    [GOLD] DELETE
     GOLD  character
     GOLD  "character"
     GOLD  'character'
 
Number refers to keypad and function keys.  CONTROL character names
specific control keys (upper- and lowercase letters are considered
equivalent).  A character following CONTROL is limited to @, A to Z, [,
\, ], ^ and _.  DELETE refers to the delete key, which is not a control
character.  Character not following CONTROL can be any keyboard key
except 0-9, though - is not useful.  Characters !, %, ', and " must be
enclosed in quotation marks; other characters can be.
3 STRING
 
Format: DEFINE KEY key-name AS 'string'
 
The string is a string of nokeypad mode commands that define the
function of the key.  If you want the command to be executed when the
key is struck, the definition must end with a period. Otherwise, EDT
will accumulate definitions until the user types a key whose definition
ends with a period, and then execute them all together.
4 ?
You can use a question mark (?) or question mark and asterisk (?*), in
key definitions to prompt the user for input.  The ? is replaced by the
characters read from the terminal before the command is executed.  A
prompt string enclosed in single quotation marks may follow the ?.  A
response to an input request generated by a ? must be terminated by
pressing a keypad or function key, whereas a response to a ?* can be
terminated by pressing a keypad key, a function key or the return key.
4 RESET
If you define a key as 'RESET' (must be exactly five characters) the
key will perform the RESET keypad function.  RESET is not a nokeypad
command.  Do not put a period at the end of the definition.
4 GOLD
If you define a key as 'GOLD' the key will perform the GOLD keypad
function.  GOLD is not a nokeypad command.  Do not put a period at the
end of the definition.
3 EXAMPLES
To define the key CTRL/A to move 3 lines, use the following command:
 
  DEFINE KEY CONTROL A AS '3L.'
 
To define the GOLDed function of the up-arrow key to mean "go to top of
buffer," use the following command:
 
  DEFINE KEY GOLD 12 AS 'BR.'
 
To define the key CTRL/D to write your COBOL identification division
header for you, use the following command:
 
  DEFINE KEY CONTROL D AS 'iIDENTIFICATION DIVISION.^Z^MiPROGRAM-ID. ?^Z.'
 
(After pressing the key, type the program name.)
 
To define the CTRL/R  key to prompt for the name of a BLISS routine,
which it will then find, use the following commmand:
 
  DEFINE KEY CONTROL R AS "BR ADV 'ROUTINE ?'Routine name: ''."

command.                                        +--+--+--+
 
2 MACRO
The DEFINE MACRO (abbreviated DEF M) command defines a line mode macro
command.
 
Format: DEFINE MACRO name
 
The name is the name of the text buffer in which the macro is stored.
The macro itself is a series of EDT line mode commands.  You invoke the
macro by giving its name in response to the line mode prompt.
1 DELETE
The DELETE (abbreviated D) command deletes the lines specified by the range.
 
Format: DELETE [range] [/QUERY]
 
If you do not specify the range, the default is the current line.
2 /QUERY
Format: /QUERY
 
When you use the QUERY (abbreviated /Q) qualifier, EDT prompts you with a
question mark (?) to verify each line to be deleted.
 
Responses are:
 
    Y   Yes, delete this line
    N   No, do not delete this line
    Q   Quit, do not delete any of the remaining lines in the range
    A   All, delete all the rest of the lines
1 EXIT
The EXIT (abbreviated EX) command terminates all action in the editor
and saves a copy of the MAIN text buffer in the output file.
 
Format: EXIT [file-spec] [/SEQUENCE:[init:incr]] [/SAVE]
 
If you omit the file specification, the output file name from the
command line that invoked EDT is used.  If no output file name has been
specified, and if /READ_ONLY and /NOOUTPUT have not been specified, then
the input file name is used.
2 /SAVE
When you use the /SAVE qualifier, the journal file is saved.  The
journal file is called 'name.JOU', where name is the output file name
from the command line. For information about the journal facility, see
HELP JOURNAL.
2 /SEQUENCE
Format: /SEQUENCE[:init:incr]
 
When you use the /SEQUENCE option, the output file is in VFC (variable
with fixed control) format, and line numbers are written in the control
field. The values of both 'init' and 'incr' must be less than 65536.
 
If you set init and incr, the file is renumbered starting with the number
you choose for init, and the lines are incremented by the number you
choose for incr.  Otherwise, the line numbers assigned by EDT are written.
These line numbers are truncated to integers and taken modulo 100000,
with a maximum value of 65535.
1 FILL
The FILL (abbreviated FIL) command reformats a block of text so that
there are as many full words on a line as possible without exceeding the
right margin.
 
Format: FILL [range]
 
The lines in the range must be contiguous.  If you omit the range, the
select range is assumed.
 
The right margin can be set by the SET WRAP command.  If the margin has
not been set, the default is the terminal width minus 1.
1 FIND
The FIND (abbreviated F) command places the cursor at the first line
specified by range.
 
Format: FIND [range]
 
The located line is not displayed.  To find and display a line, use the
TYPE command.
 
Ex: F=X.   Returns EDT to buffer X, to the line EDT was on when you last
           left buffer X.  Note the dot (.) after the buffer name.  This
           specifies the line that EDT was on when you last left buffer
           X.
1 INCLUDE
The INCLUDE (abbreviated INC) command copies external files into text
buffers.
 
Format: INCLUDE file-spec [range]
 
The specified file is copied to the location before the first line of
the range. Note that range specifies the position to which the file will
be copied; it does not restrict the portion of the file which will be
included.  To include part of a file, first INCLUDE the file into a
buffer; then COPY the desired portion of the included text into the
appropriate buffer.
1 INSERT
The INSERT (abbreviated I) command inserts new text into a text
buffer.
 
Format: INSERT [range] ;line to be inserted
    Or: INSERT [range]
        text to be inserted
        ^Z
 
The new text is inserted above the first line specified by range.  If
you omit range, new text is inserted above the current line.
 
If you choose the first form of the INSERT command, the text on the line
following the semicolon is inserted and the editor does not enter insert
mode.  This is the only form of the INSERT command that should be used
in a startup command file or macro.
 
If you choose the second form, EDT enters insert mode.  In insert mode,
you can enter as many lines of text as you wish, terminating each line
by pressing return.  Terminate insert mode by pressing CTRL/Z.
 
The line following the last line inserted becomes the current line.
1 JOURNAL
EDT saves all input from the terminal during an editing session in a
file called the journal file.   The journal file is deleted when you
exit the editor with an EXIT or QUIT command (without the /SAVE option).
If the editor is left involuntarily, the journal file is saved.
 
The journal file can be used to redo all the operations of an editing
session. The edited file is thereby recreated.  Type the same command
line used previously with the addition of the /RECOVER qualifier.  All
input files used in the original session must be available under the
same names as when they were first read.
 
Unless explicitly overridden by the /JOURNAL qualifier on the command
line, the journal file will have the same name as the output file,
except that the file type will be JOU and the file will be written in
the current default directory.
1 MOVE
The MOVE (abbreviated M) command moves text from one location to
another, deleting it from the original location.
 
Format: MOVE [range-1] TO [range-2] [/QUERY]
 
The lines specified by range-1 are moved to a location immediately
above the first line specified by range-2.  The lines are deleted from
the original location.  If you omit either of the range specifications,
the current line is used.  The first line of range-2 becomes the new
current line.  To move lines of text without deleting them from  the
original location, see the COPY command.
2 /QUERY
Format: /QUERY
 
When you use the QUERY (abbreviated /Q) qualifier, EDT prompts you with
a question mark (?) to verify each line to be moved.
 
Responses are:
 
    Y   Yes, move this line.
    N   No, do not move this line.
    Q   Quit, do not move any of the remaining lines in the range
    A   All, move all the rest of the lines.
1 PRINT
The PRINT (abbreviated P) command creates a listing file with the
specified file name.
 
Format: PRINT file-spec [range]
 
The lines selected by range are written to a listing format file with
page headers.  If the NUMBERS option is set (see SET NUMBERS), the EDT
line numbers will appear on the listing.  If you omit range, the entire
current buffer is printed.  Print does not alter the current line.  Use
PRINT only to create a listing.  If you wish to create a file, use the
WRITE command.
1 QUIT
The QUIT command exits the editor without saving the contents of the
MAIN buffer.
 
Format: QUIT [/SAVE]
 
Use the QUIT command only if you have made no changes to the buffer you
are editing or if you have decided you do not wish to save the changes
you have made.  All edits will be discarded when you QUIT from the
editor.
2 /SAVE
The SAVE qualifier specifies that the journal file should be saved.
Normally, the journal file is deleted when you QUIT.
1 RANGE
Range specifications select the exact lines of text on which the line
editing command will operate.
 
There are several general classes of range specifications:
 
    1.  Single line ranges specify a single line of text.
    2.  Multiple line ranges specify blocks of text, such as an entire buffer
        or all lines from the current line to the end of the buffer.
    3.  Compound ranges combine single line ranges with operators to specify
        multiple lines of text.
    4.  Noncontiguous ranges specify multiple lines that are not necessarily
        adjacent to one another.
2 ALL
The ALL range further refines a general range specification.
 
Format: [range] ALL 'string'
 
While range can be a single, multiple, or compound range, the command
being performed will only apply to those lines of text containing the
given string. This string can be enclosed in single or double quotation
marks.
 
Ex: TYPE ALL 'EDT'          When ALL is used, the default for range is
                            WHOLE.  This command will type all the lines
                            in the current buffer containing the string
                            'EDT'.
 
    SUBS/A/B/50:100 ALL '1' Substitute B for A in all lines from 50 to
                            100 which include the string 1.
2 AND
The AND range selects a group of single lines.
 
Format: range-1 AND range-2 AND range3 ...
    Or: range-1 , range-2 , range3 ...
 
Each of the ranges must be a single line range.  Each of the single
lines is operated on.
 
Ex: TYPE 4 AND 7     Lines 4 and 7 are displayed on the terminal
 
    TYPE BEGIN,END-1 The first and last lines are displayed on the
                     terminal
2 BEGIN
The BEGIN range (abbreviated B) is a single line range that specifies
the first line in the buffer.
2 BEFORE
The BEFORE range (abbreviated BEF) is a multiple line range that
specifies all the lines in the buffer preceding the current line.
2 BUFFER
The BUFFER (abbreviated BU) specification may precede any other range
specification and indicates that the range is to be applied to a named
buffer.
 
Format: BUFFER name [range]
    Or: =name [range]
 
The two forms are equivalent.  Name is the name of the buffer in which
the text resides.  If you leave out the range, the entire buffer is
selected.
2 DOT
The dot (.) is a single line range that refers to the current line of
text. For many commands, dot is the default range.  See the help text
for a command if you are unsure of the default.
 
Ex: TYPE .    Display the current line.
2 END
The END (abbreviated E) range specifies an imaginary line following the
last line in the buffer.  END does not specify the last line in the
buffer.  The last line can be referred to by E-1 (that is, the line
preceding END).  When the END line is typed, it looks like:
 
[EOB]
2 FOR
The FOR range is a multiple line range that selects a specified number
of lines starting at a specified location.
 
Format: [range] FOR n
    Or: [range] # n
 
The two forms are equivalent.  Range is a single line range that
specifies the starting position, and n is an integer number.  If range
is omitted, the current line is the starting position.
 
Ex: TYPE . FOR 5      Display 5 lines, starting with the current line
 
    TYPE #5           Equivalent to the previous example
 
    TYPE BEGIN FOR 10 Display the first 10 lines in the buffer
2 LAST
The LAST (abbreviated L) range is a single line range that refers to the
line in the previous buffer which was the current line when you switched
to the current buffer.
2 MINUS
The minus sign (-) in ranges selects a single line that is a specified
number of lines before a specified line.
 
Format: [range] - [n]
 
Range is a single line range, and n is an integer.  The line selected is
the line that is n lines before the line specified by range.  If you
omit range, the current line is used; if you omit n, 1 is used.
 
Ex: TYPE 15 - 3     Display the third line before the line numbered 15.
 
    TYPE END -1     Display the last line in the buffer.
 
    TYPE -          Display the previous line.
2 NUMBER
A line number is a single line range that refers to the line having the
specified number.  The line number may contain a decimal point.
 
Ex: TYPE 10     Display line number 10.
 
    INSERT 65.3 Insert above line 65.3.
 
The maximum allowable line number is 2814749767.  A line number may have
up to five digits to the right of the decimal point.
 
You can change the line number with the RESEQUENCE command.  In
addition, the INSERT and INCLUDE commands will automatically change the
numbers of existing lines if necessary to make each line in a buffer to
have a line number larger than the previous line.
 
When lines are read from the primary input file and that file has
sequence numbers, the line number assigned is the sequence number from
the file, plus N*100000, where N is large enough to ensure that each
line in the buffer has a line number larger than the previous line.
File sequence numbers range in value from 0 to 65535.
2 ORIGINAL
Format: ORIGINAL n
 
The ORIGINAL (abbreviated O) range is no longer a feature of EDT.  The
keyword ORIGINAL is ignored; the number specified is taken as an editing
line number.  See HELP RANGE NUMBER for more information.
2 PLUS
The plus sign selects, in ranges, a single line that is a specified
number of lines after a specified line.
 
Format: [range] + [n]
 
Range is a single line range, and n is an integer.  The line selected is
the line that is n lines after the line specified by range.  If you omit
range, the current line is used.  If you omit n, 1 is used.
 
Ex: TYPE 15 + 3     Display the third line after the line numbered 15.
 
    TYPE BEGIN +1   Display the second line in the buffer.
 
    TYPE +          Display the line following the current line.
 
    TYPE 'string'+2 Display the second line following the next line
                    continaing 'string'.
2 REST
The REST (abbreviated R) range is a multiple line range that refers to
the current line and all lines following in the buffer.
2 SELECT
The SELECT range is a multiple line range that contains all lines
between the current line and the SELECT mark.  The SELECT mark is set by
the change mode SEL nokeypad command or the keypad SELECT function.
2 STRING
A quoted string specifies a single line that contains the  specified
string. You can enclose the string in either single or double quotation
marks (' or ").  When you use a string as a range, EDT will search
forward, starting with the current line, until it locates a line with
the specified string.  If a minus sign (-) precedes the string, the
search will be backward.
 
Ex: TYPE 'abc'  Locate and display the first line forward that contains
                the string 'abc'.
 
    TYPE -"abc" Same, except the search will be backward.
2 THRU
The THRU range is a compound range that specifies all lines between two
single line ranges.
 
Format: range-1 THRU range-2
    Or: range-1 : range-2
 
Both forms are equivalent.  Starting with range-1, EDT selects all the
lines up to and including the line specified by range-2.
 
Ex: TYPE 15:30       Display all lines with numbers between 15 and 30.
 
    TYPE 'glorp':END Display all lines from the first line forward
                     containing 'glorp' to the end.
2 WHOLE
The WHOLE (abbreviated W) range refers to the entire text buffer.
1 REPLACE
The REPLACE (abbreviated R) command deletes the specified range of lines
and then places EDT in INSERT mode.
 
Format: REPLACE [range] ;text to insert
    Or: REPLACE [range]
        text to insert
        ^Z
 
When you do not specify a range, replace deletes the current line and
inserts the new text at that location.
 
If you use the first form of the REPLACE command, EDT inserts the text
in the command line following the semicolon and the editor does not
enter insert mode.  This is the only form of the REPLACE command that
should be used in startup command files and macros.
 
If you use the second form, EDT enters insert mode.  In insert mode you
can enter as many lines of text as you wish, terminating each line with
a carriage return.  You terminate insert mode by pressing CTRL/Z.
 
The line following the last line inserted becomes the current line.
1 RESEQUENCE
The RESEQUENCE (abbreviated RES) command assigns new line numbers to a
range of lines.
 
Format: RESEQUENCE [range] [/SEQUENCE:init:incr]
 
The specified range of lines must be contiguous. When you do not specify
a range, all lines in the  current buffer are resequenced.  If the new
numbers assigned would cause duplicate or nonsequential line numbers,
EDT will either disallow the command or renumber lines beyond the
specified range.
 
Note that the total count of lines resequenced (which is displayed upon
completion of the command), may differ from the number of lines
originally specified in the range, due to the possibility of extra
renumbering.
2 /SEQUENCE
The SEQUENCE (abbreviated /SEQ) qualifier specifies the sequence of
numbers to be assigned.  The init parameter specifies the initial
number, and incr specifies the number by which the lines are
incremented.  If you do not use the SEQUENCE qualifier, init and incr
both default to 1.
 
The maximum allowable line number is 2814749767.  If, during
resequencing, a line number plus 'incr' would exceed this value, that
line and all remaining lines will be numbered 2814749767.  You should
correct this immediately by resequencing with a different 'init' and/or
smaller 'incr'.
1 SET
The SET (abbreviated SE) command sets options that control other editor
operations. Once set, these options are in effect throughout the rest of
the edit session or until changed by the SET command.
2 AUTOREPEAT
The SET AUTOREPEAT (abbreviated SE AUTOREPEAT) command enables EDT's use
of the DECARM VT100 control sequence to prevent keypad, function and
arrow keys from repeating faster than EDT can update the screen.  If you
do not want EDT to manipulate the VT100's autorepeat feature, use SET
NOAUTOREPEAT (abbreviated SE NOAUTOREPEAT).  On some VT100-class
terminals, SET AUTOREPEAT can cause the arrow keys to repeat at the rate
of 2 per second rather than the usual 30 per second.  With SET
NOAUTOREPEAT the arrow keys repeat faster, but the screen is not updated
for each repeat of the arrow key, since EDT skips intermediate updates
if it gets behind.
 
Format: SET [NO]AUTOREPEAT
2 CASE
Format: SET CASE { UPPER | LOWER | NONE }
 
Use the SET CASE (abbreviated SE CA) command on terminals which are
capable of displaying uppercase characters only.  SET CASE instructs EDT
to flag with a preceding apostrophe either the uppercase characters, the
lowercase characters, or neither.  The default for SET CASE is NONE,
which means no characters are flagged.
 
You can abbreviate the keywords as follows:
 
    CASE    CA
    UPPER   U
    LOWER   L
    NONE    N
2 COMMAND
Format: SET COMMAND file-specification
 
The SET COMMAND (abbreviated SE COMMAND) command is used in a startup
command file to specify the name of the next startup command file to
read.  EDT provides a default file type of ".EDT".  If the file is not
present this command does nothing; otherwise it causes the current
command file to be abandoned and the new one to be read in its place.
3 STARTUP
When EDT starts up, it reads the installation default startup command
file.  The name of the file is always EDTSYS.  The default name varies
depending on the system, as follows:
 
                   Default Name
                   -----------------
VAX/VMS            SYS$LIBRARY:.EDT
RSX-11M & M-PLUS   LB:[1,2].EDT
RSTS/E             LB:.EDT
 
When opening the file, EDT combines the name and the default name
together into a complete file specification.  On VAX/VMS, therefore, if
the logical name EDTSYS is defined, EDT will read from it rather than
from SYS$LIBRARY:EDTSYS.EDT.
 
The installation default startup command file should have SET COMMAND
EDTINI at its end, so that the user's initialization file will be read
after the installation default initialization file.   If EDTSYS is not
found, EDT will try again using the name EDTINI, so there is no need for
an installation-default initialization file that just contains SET
COMMAND EDTINI.
2 CURSOR
Format: SET CURSOR top:bottom
 
The SET CURSOR (abbreviated SE CU) command, used with screen editing,
sets the limits within which the cursor is allowed to move without
scrolling the screen.
 
Top and bottom are the line numbers at the top of the screen and the
bottom of the screen.  The line numbers must be in the range of 0 to 21,
with 0 specifying the top of the screen and 21 the bottom.  The default
setting is 7:14, allowing the cursor to move within the middle third of
the screen.  If SET LINES is used to decrease the number of lines shown
on the screen, the top and bottom of the cursor limits must be within
the number of lines on the screen.
2 ENTITY
Format: SET ENTITY entity-type 'delimiter string'
 
Where entity-type is one of the following:
 
    WORD        (abbreviated W)
    SENTENCE    (abbreviated S)
    PAGE        (abbreviated PAG)
    PARAGRAPH   (abbreviated PAR)
 
The SET ENTITY (abbreviated SE EN) command sets the delimiters for the
user-defined change mode entities.  For the WORD and SENTENCE entities,
the delimiter string is a set of single character delimiters.  For PAGE
and PARAGRAPH, the delimiter is a character string that delimits the
entity.  See HELP CHANGE ENTITIES for explanations of the entities.
2 FNF
Format: SET [NO]FNF
 
The SET FNF option controls whether or not an informative message is
displayed when you attempt to edit a non-existing file.  NOFNF opens a
new file but gives no message.
2 HELP
Format: SET HELP [file-specification]
 
The SET HELP (abbreviated SE H) option lets you define which help file
will be accessed when you either give the HELP command or press the HELP
key in keypad mode.  The default device and directory are always as
listed below unless overriden by an explicit device and directory.  SET
HELP without a file specification returns you to the original default
help file.
 
The following are default specifications for the various systems:
 
                   File specification  Name      Type
                   ------------------  ----      ----
VAX/VMS            SYS$HELP: .HLB      EDTHELP   .HLB
RSX-11M & M-PLUS   LB:[1,2] .HLP       EDTHELP   .HLP
RSTS/E             LB: .HLP            EDTHEL    .HLP
 
2 KEYPAD
Format: SET [NO]KEYPAD
 
The SET KEYPAD (abbreviated SE K) option controls whether or not the
editing keypad is to be used when you are in CHANGE mode.  KEYPAD is set
by default for VT100 and VT52 terminals, which means the alternate
keypad is used to enter change mode commands.  For terminals with
function keys, the function keys can also be used in KEYPAD mode.
2 LINES
The SET LINES (abbreviated SE L) command controls the number of screen
lines used in either of the screen versions of change mode.  Use this
option to reduce the time it takes to refresh the screen image when
editing on slow terminals.
 
Format: SET LINES n
 
where n is the number of lines to use.  n must be between 1 and 22.  By
default, n is set to 22 lines.  If the cursor limits are larger than n-1
they are reduced to n-1.  See SET CURSOR.
2 MODE
The SET MODE (abbreviated SE M) command determines which mode of editing
should be entered after all initial processing is complete.  This
command is useful only in the startup command file.
 
Format: SET MODE { LINE | CHANGE }
 
By default, EDT enters line mode when the startup processing is
complete.  Use SET MODE CHANGE in your startup command file to cause EDT
to enter change mode when startup processing is complete.
2 NUMBERS
Format: SET [NO]NUMBERS
 
The SET NUMBERS (abbreviated SE NU) command controls the display of line
numbers on the terminal.  Numbers are set on by default.  If you want to
suppress numbers, use SET NONUMBERS (abbreviated SE NON).
2 PARAGRAPH
Format: SET PARAGRAPH [NO]WPS
 
The SET PARAGRAPH (abbreviated SE PARA) command specifies a paragraph as
the text between two delimiters and including any adjacent delimiters
(WPS), or the text between two delimiters (NOWPS).
2 PROMPT
Format: SET PROMPT prompt-type 'string'
 
Where prompt-type is either LINE, KEYPAD, NOKEYPAD, HCCHANGE, INSERT,
INSERTN, or QUERY.
 
The SET PROMPT command allows redefinition of the prompt string that is
displayed in line mode, in keypad mode, in nokeypad mode, in hardcopy
change mode, in line mode when inserting, in line mode when inserting
with NONUMBERS, and with the /QUERY qualifier.
 
EDT will become confused if the new string for the keypad or nokeypad
prompt causes a net motion of the cursor.  If a <CR><LF> pair is not
included in the new string for any prompt which has it in the default
prompt, these characters will be inserted at the beginning of the new
string.
2 QUIET
The SET QUIET (abbreviated SE Q) command controls whether or not the
bell will sound when an error is made in change mode.
 
Format: SET [NO]QUIET
 
The quiet option is off (meaning the bell will sound) by default.
2 REPEAT
The SET REPEAT (abbreviated SE REP) command enables you to use the GOLD
key followed by digits to represent a count.  If you do not want the
ability to use counts, use SET NOREPEAT (abbreviated SE NOREP).  A
warning bell sounds if you attempt to use counts with NOREPEAT set.
 
Format: SET [NO]REPEAT
 
By default, REPEAT is enabled.
2 SCREEN
The SET SCREEN (abbreviated SE SC) command specifies the width of your
terminal.
 
Format: SET SCREEN w
 
where w is the width of the screen line.  By default, the screen width
is set to the terminal's width, as reported to EDT by the operating
system.  On VT100-type terminals you can set the width to 80 or 132, and
EDT will adjust the terminal appropriately.  On other CRT terminals you
should only use the terminal's fixed width: 80 for VT52s and 84 for
VK100s.
2 SEARCH
The SET SEARCH (abbreviated SE SE) command controls several options
related to string searching.
 
Format: SET SEARCH { GENERAL | EXACT | WPS |
                     CASE INSENSITIVE | CI |
                     DIACRITICAL INSENSITIVE | DI }
                   { [UN]BOUNDED }
                   { BEGIN | END }
3 GENERAL
The GENERAL option will cause the case of letters and the presence or
absence of diacritical marks to be ignored in search strings.  GENERAL
is the default.
3 EXACT
The EXACT option will require all characters to match exactly, including
the case of letters and the presence of diacritical marks, in search
strings.
3 WPS
The WPS option will cause a case-independent string match for lowercase
letters in the search string, and a case-dependent match for uppercase
letters in the search string.
3 CI
The CI option will cause the case of letters to be ignored in search
strings, but not the presence of diacritical marks.  CI is an
abbreviation for CASE INSENSITIVE.
3 DI
The DI option will cause diacritical marks on letters to be ignored in
string searches, but not the case of the letters.  DI is an abbreviation
for DIACRITICAL INSENSITIVE.
3 BOUNDED
The BOUNDED (abbreviated BO) option will cause the search to be bounded
by a page delimiter.  By default, the search is unbounded, which means
that the entire buffer will be searched.  This option has effect only in
change mode.
 
The UNBOUNDED (abbreviated U) option causes the search not to be bounded
by a page delimiter, which means that the entire buffer will be
searched.  This is the default.  This option has effect only in change
mode.
3 BEGIN
The BEGIN (abbreviated B) option causes the cursor to be left at the
beginning of the search string when it is found. This is the default.
This option has effect only in change mode.
3 END
The END (abbreviated E) option causes the cursor to be left at the end
of the search string when it is found. By default, the cursor is left at
the beginning. This option has effect only in change mode.
2 SUMMARY
The SET [NO]SUMMARY command controls whether or not summary information
about a file written with the WRITE or EXIT commands will be typed out.
The default is SUMMARY, which means that summary information is typed.
 
Format: SET [NO]SUMMARY
 
2 TAB
The SET TAB (abbreviated SE TA) command enables the structured tab
feature and sets the logical tab size.
 
Format: SET [NO]TAB n
 
where n is the number of columns in a logical tab stop.
 
With the structured tab feature, EDT keeps a counter of the tab level,
which is set to 1 when the SET TAB command is issued. When you use the
tab key in change mode at the beginning of a line, EDT inserts enough
tabs and spaces to move the cursor to the column defined by the level n
times the tab size.  Change mode nokeypad commands can alter the tab level.
The structured tab feature is disabled by default.
 
The tab size set by the tab command is also used by the TABS ADJUST
command.
2 TERMINAL
Format: SET TERMINAL { HCPY | VT100 | VT52 }
                     { SCROLL | NOSCROLL }
                     { EDIT | NOEDIT }
                     { EIGHTBIT | NOEIGHTBIT }
 
The SET TERMINAL (abbreviated SE TE) command identifies to EDT the type
of terminal you are using.  Normally, EDT will set the terminal type by
asking the operating system what type it is.  If it does not appear to
have set the type correctly, you can use the SHOW TERMINAL command to
see what EDT thinks your terminal is and the SET TERMINAL command to
correct it if necessary.  If your terminal is not a VT100 or a VT52, it
should be set to HCPY (hardcopy).
3 HCPY
HCPY stands for hardcopy.  EDT considers a terminal hardcopy if it is
not a VT100 or a VT52.  On such terminals change mode does not use the
screen as a window onto your buffer, but instead shows you the current
line with the cursor position indicated.  You type NOKEYPAD commands and
EDT will keep you informed by printing the current line after each
command.
3 VT100
The VT100 is a family of terminals, all based on the original VT100
terminal. This class of terminals includes the VT101, VT102, VT125,
VT131 and VT132.
3 VT52
The VT52 terminal is the predecessor of the VT100 family.  It does not
have reverse video, and has fewer keys in its keypad.
3 SCROLL
This option indicates that your terminal has scrolling regions and EDT
may use them.  This is the default for most VT100 terminals.
3 NOSCROLL
This option indicates that either your terminal does not have scrolling
regions or EDT should not use them.  This is the default for VT52
terminals.
3 EDIT
This option indicates that your terminal has the screen editing features
of the VT102.  These are IL (insert line), DL (delete line), ICM (insert
character mode) and DCH (delete characters).
3 NOEDIT
This option indicates that your terminal does not have the screen
editing features of the VT102.
3 EIGHTBIT
This option indicates that your terminal contains the DEC Multinational
Character Set, which extends ASCII to include letters with diacritical
marks and other characters used in Europe.
3 NOEIGHTBIT
This option indicates that your terminal does not contain the DEC
Multinational character set.  On such a terminal characters which cannot
be displayed directly are displayed using <>.
2 TEXT
Format:  SET TEXT text-type 'string'
 
Text-type is one of the following:
 
    PAGE
    END
 
The SET TEXT command allows you to define the displayed string to
indicate a formfeed character (SET TEXT PAGE), and the displayed string
to indicate the end of the buffer (SET TEXT END).  The string can not
contain control or escape characters.
2 TRUNCATE
The SET TRUNCATE (abbreviated SE TR) command controls the handling of
long lines in change mode.
 
Format: SET [NO]TRUNCATE
 
By default, truncate mode is set, which means long lines will be
truncated on the display (the actual text is not altered).  If you turn
off truncate mode by using SET NOTRUNCATE, long lines will be wrapped to
as many screen lines as are necessary to display the entire line.
2 VERIFY
The SET VERIFY (abbreviated SE V) command controls the listing of
commands that are executed from the startup command file or from a
macro.
 
Format: SET [NO]VERIFY
 
Verify is off by default, which means the lines are not typed.  If you
turn it on, each command line is typed as it is executed.
2 WORD
Format: SET WORD [NO]DELIMITER
 
The SET WORD (abbreviated SE W) command enables you to specify that the
word delimiters be considered words by themselves (NODELIMITER), or
considered as part of the word they delimit (DELIMITER).  The default is
DELIMITER.
 
2 WRAP
Format: SET [NO]WRAP n
 
The SET WRAP (abbreviated SE W) command enables word wrapping and
specifies the right margin.  Word wrapping is a feature of EDT that
automatically insert carriage returns when the text you are typing
exceeds the right margin.  Word wrapping is in effect in change mode
only and only if you have used the SET WRAP command.
 
The SET WRAP command also sets the right margin for the nokeypad mode
FILL commmand.
 
SET NOWRAP (abbreviated SE NOW) disables the word wrapping feature.
1 SHOW
Format: SHOW parameter
 
The SHOW (abbreviated SH) command displays selected information on the
current state of the editor.  Parameter is one of the additional topics
listed below.
2 AUTOREPEAT
Format: SHOW AUTOREPEAT
 
The SHOW AUTOREPEAT command displays whether EDT is allowed to
manipulate the Autorepeat feature of VT100-type terminals or not.  See
SET AUTOREPEAT for more information.
2 BUFFER
Format: SHOW BUFFER
 
The SHOW BUFFER (abbreviated SH BU) command lists the buffers being used
during the edit session, including the number of lines of text in each
buffer. The current  buffer is marked by an  equal sign (=) before the
name.  If an asterisk follows the number of lines, it indicates that an
input file is connected to the buffer and that there are more lines to
be read from the file. Thus, the line count is not accurate.
2 CASE
Format: SHOW CASE
 
The SHOW CASE (abbreviated SH CA) command shows the current case setting
(upper, lower, or none).
2 COMMAND
Format: SHOW COMMAND
 
The SHOW COMMAND (abbreviated SH COMMAND) command shows the name of the
last specified startup command file.  For more information see
HELP SET COMMAND.
2 CURSOR
Format: SHOW CURSOR
 
The SHOW CURSOR (abbreviated SH CU) command shows the current setting of
the cursor region.  EDT will respond with:
 
t:b
 
where t and b are integer numbers indicating the top and bottom of the
cursor region.  See HELP SET CURSOR for an explanation of the cursor
region.
2 ENTITY
Format: SHOW ENTITY entity-type
 
where entity-type is one of the following:
 
    WORD      (abbreviated W)
    SENTENCE  (abbreviated S)
    PAGE      (abbreviated PAG)

Any nonalphanumeric character except % can be used as string delimiters.
 
All occurrences of string-1 within the specified range are replaced with
string-2.  If you do not specify range, a single occurrence in the
current line is substituted.  The line in which the substitution
occurred is typed after each substitution.

    Q   Quit, terminate the command.
    A   All, do the rest of the substitutions without query.
1 TAB
The TAB ADJUST (abbreviated TA A) command shifts each of a range of
lines a specified number of logical tab stops.
 
Format: TAB ADJUST [-] n [range]
 
where n is the number of tab stops to shift.  You must use the SET TAB
command to set the logical tab size in order for this command  to work.
If you omit range, the select range is assumed.  If a minus sign (-)
precedes the count n, the text shifts to the left.  Otherwise, it shifts
to the right.
1 TYPE
The TYPE (abbreviated T) command displays the specified range of lines
on the terminal.
 
Format: TYPE [range] [/BRIEF[:n]] [/STAY]
 
The first line in the specified range becomes the current line.
 
If the range specification starts with a nonalphabetic character, the
keyword TYPE may be omitted completely.
2 /BRIEF
Format: /BRIEF[:n]
 
When you select the /BRIEF (abbreviated /BR) option, only the first n
characters of the  line are displayed.  If you omit n, the default
is 10.
2 /STAY
Format: /STAY

is not changed by the TYPE command.  This enables you to look at text
elsewhere in the buffer (or in another buffer) without losing your
position.
1 WRITE
The WRITE (abbreviated WR) command creates a file from a specified range
of lines.
 
Format: WRITE file-spec [range] [/SEQUENCE[:init:incr]]
 
When you specify a range, the text contained in that range becomes the
file. When you do not specify a range, the contents of the current text
buffer becomes the new file.  The cursor position is not affected by the
WRITE command.
2 /SEQUENCE
Format: /SEQUENCE[:init:incr]
 
When you use the /SEQUENCE option, the output file is in VFC (variable
with fixed control) format, and line numbers are written in the control
field. The values of both 'init' and 'incr' must be less than 65536.
 
If you set init and incr, the file is renumbered starting with the number
you choose for init, and the lines are incremented by the number you
choose for incr.  Otherwise, the line numbers assigned by EDT are written.
These line numbers are truncated to integers and taken modulo 100000,
with a maximum value of 65535.
