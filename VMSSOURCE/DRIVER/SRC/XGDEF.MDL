;
; LAPB - Data structure for the buffer allocated when the xgdriver is
;	 running in LAPB mode.
;
;-	

	$STRUCT	LAPB
	F	HDR,L,3			; 3 longwords for the buffer header
	L	HDRLEN			; The header length
	F	,L,1			; reserved
;
; Please note that the following field is necessary because the XMTER
; in the XGDRIVER expects this field to be there. It is only useful
; however when the driver is running DDCMP mode.
;
	F	XQCNT,B			; Count of messages queued
	F	,B,1			; Reserved
	L	ERRSTRT			; Start of the error counters
	F	DEITYP,W		; Data errors inbound
	F	DEIBC,W			; Data error inbound bit counter
	V	<M
		IHCRC,,,M		; Inbound header CRC error
		IDCRC,,,M		; Inbound data CRC error
		>
	F	DEI,B			; Data error inbound counter
	L	ERREND			; End of the error counters
	F	,B,1			; reserved
	F	,L,2			; reserved
; 
; The following fields must appear in this place in the LAPB buffer. The reason
; is that the xgdriver expects to transmit all IO's from a given queue. The
; queue it expects to use is at this offset in the DDCMP definitions. There
; is an ASSUME statement which will break in the driver if this is not the
; case. Also remember that DDCMP has two transmit queus, one for control
; messages and one for data messages.
;
	F	XMTQ,Q			; List head for the XMTQ
	F	CLEANQ,Q		; List head for the CLEAN queue
	F	BLANK,Q			; End of LAPB XMT QUEUES
	L	LENGTH
	E

; BISYNC- Data structure for the buffer allocated when the xgdriver is
;	 running in BISYNC mode.
;-

	$STRUCT	BISYNC
	F	HDR,L,3			; 3 longwords for the buffer header
	L	HDRLEN			; the header length
	F	RCV_INDEX,W		; Current index into RCV buffer
	F	STATUS,W		; Status word
	V	<M
		RCV_COMPLETE,,,M	; Receive completed posted to user
		TIMER_RUNNING,,,M	; TQE is running
		>
;
; See explanation in LAPB
;
	F	XQCNT,B			; Count of messages xmted
	F	DROP_RCV,W		; Count of RCVs dropped to large for buff
	F	,B,1			; resvered
	F	INIT_STATE_INFO,Q	; Initial state information
	F	RCV_BUFFER,A		; Device RCV buffer address

; The following fields must appear in this place in the BISYNC buffer. For 
; partly the same reason as LAPB except that we can not queue messages to the
; same queues. The reason we can not use the same queues is that BISYNC
; can run in HALF duplex mode. In order to be consistent with half
; duplex mode for DDCMP both modes must queue the messages to the same
; queue, the ddcmp XMTQ and the bisync XMTQ are made the same queue.

	F	BLANK,Q			; spare queue (ddcmp ctlq and lapb xmtq)
	F	CLEANQ,Q		; Bisync CLEANQ
	F	XMTQ,Q			; Bisync XMTQ
	F	TQE,L,15		; Buffer for TQE
	L	LENGTH
	E
