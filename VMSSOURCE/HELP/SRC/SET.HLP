  Format:

    SET ACCOUNTING
3 Command_Qualifiers

/DISABLE

 /DISABLE=(keyword[,...])

 Disables the logging of all activities in the  accounting  log  file.
  To  disable specific activities selectively, you include one or more
  keywords with /DISABLE.  When you specify  more  than  one  keyword,
  separate   them   with   commas  and  enclose  the  entire  list  in
  parentheses.  Table 14  in  the  VAX/VMS  DCL Dictionary  lists  and 
  describes the activities that can be disabled.

/ENABLE

 /ENABLE=(keyword[,...])

 Enables the logging of all activities in  the  accounting  file.   To
  enable  specific  activities  selectively,  you  include one or more
  keywords with /ENABLE.  When you  specify  more  than  one  keyword,
  separate  them  with  commas  and  enclose  the  entire  list within
  parentheses.  Table 14  in  the  VAX/VMS  DCL Dictionary  lists  and
  describes the activities that can be enabled.

/NEW_FILE

 /NEW_FILE

 Closes the current accounting file and opens a new  version  of  that
  file.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET ACCOUNTING/ENABLE=(BATCH,INTERACTIVE)

  This command  requests  that  all  batch  and  interactive  jobs  be
  recorded in the accounting file at job termination.

  2.   $ SET ACCOUNTING/NEW_FILE

  version of it.
2 ACL

  Allows you to modify the access control list (ACL) of an object.



  Format:



    SET ACL object-name

3 Parameters



 object-name



  Specifies the object  whose  access  control  list  (ACL)  is  being

  modified.   Wildcard characters are not allowed in the object names.

  Each file must be a disk  file  on  a  Files-11  Structure  Level  2

  formatted volume.

3 Command_Qualifiers



/ACL


 /ACL[=(ace[,...])]



 Specifies one or more access control entries (ACEs) to  be  modified.

  When  no  ACE  is  specified,  the  entire  access  control  list is

  affected.  Separate multiple ACEs with commas.  The  specified  ACEs

  are  inserted  at  the top of the ACL unless the /AFTER qualifier is

  given.



/AFTER


 /AFTER=ace



 Indicates that all access control entries (ACEs) specified  with  the

  /ACL qualifier will be added after the ACE specified with the /AFTER

  qualifier.  By default any ACEs added to the ACL are  always  placed

  at the top of the list.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/BEFORE


 /BEFORE[=time]



 Selects a file that is dated before  the  specified  time.   You  can

  specify  either  an  absolute  time or a combination of absolute and

  delta times.   See  Section  2.5  in  the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary (or

  access  the  HELP  topic  SPECIFY)   for  complete   information  on

  specifying  time  values.   You  can  also  use  the keywords TODAY,

  TOMORROW, and YESTERDAY.  If no time is specified, TODAY is assumed.



  This qualifier cannot be used with  the  /EDIT  qualifier,  or  with

  /OBJECT_TYPE=DEVICE.



/BY_OWNER


 /BY_OWNER[=uic]



 Selects A file whose owner user identification code (UIC) matches the

  specified  owner  UIC.   If  the  /BY_OWNER  qualifier  is specified

  without a UIC, the UIC of the current process is assumed.



  Specify the UIC using standard UIC format as  described  in  Section

  3.7.1  in  the  VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary (or  access  the  HELP  topic

  the HELP topic SPECIFY).



  This qualifier cannot be used with  the  /EDIT  qualifier,  or  with

  /OBJECT_TYPE=DEVICE.



/CONFIRM



 /CONFIRM

 /NOCONFIRM



  Controls whether a request is issued before each individual SET  ACL

  operation  to confirm that the operation should be performed on that

  object.  This qualifier can be used only with file and device object

  types.



  When the system  issues  the  prompt,  you  can  issue  any  of  the

  following responses:



       YES    NO       QUIT

       TRUE   FALSE    <CTRL/Z>

       1      0        ALL

              <RET>    



  You can use any combination of upper- and lowercase letters for word

  responses.  Word responses can be abbreviated to one or more letters

  (for example, T, TR, or TRU for TRUE).  Affirmative answers are YES,

  TRUE, and 1.  Negative answers are NO, FALSE, 0, and <RET>.  QUIT or

  <CTRL/Z> indicates that you want to stop processing the  command  at

  that  point.   When  you  respond with ALL, the command continues to

  process, but no further prompts are given.  If you type  a  response

  other than one of those in the list, the prompt will be reissued.



  This qualifier cannot be used with  the  /EDIT  qualifier,  or  with

  /OBJECT_TYPE=DEVICE.



/CREATED



 /CREATED



 Selects a file  based  on  its  creation  date.   This  qualifier  is

  relevant only when used with the /BEFORE or /SINCE qualifier.



  This qualifier cannot be used with  the  /EDIT  qualifier,  or  with

  /OBJECT_TYPE=DEVICE.



/DEFAULT



 /DEFAULT



 Creates an ACL for the specified file(s) as if the  file  were  newly

  created.   For  a  directory file, the /DEFAULT qualifier propagates

  the entire ACL (except ACEs with the NOPROPAGATE option) so  that  a

  particular   access   protection  can  be  propagated  throughout  a

  directory  tree.   For  all  other  files,  the  /DEFAULT  qualifier

  propagates  the  DEFAULT  option  ACE(s)  in  the  ACL of the parent

  directory to the ACL of the specified file(s).



  The /DEFAULT qualifier uses the ACL of the parent directory  of  the

  specified  file,  not the current default directory.  This qualifier

  cannot   be   used   with   the    /EDIT    qualifier,    or    with

  /OBJECT_TYPE=DEVICE.



/DELETE



 /DELETE



 Indicates that the access control entries (ACEs) specified  with  the

  /ACL  qualifier  are  to  be deleted.  If no ACEs are specified with

  /ACL, the entire ACL is deleted (except  those  with  the  PROTECTED

  option)  .   If you specify an ACE that does not exist with the /ACL

  qualifier, you will be notified that the ACE does not exist and  the

  delete operation will continue.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/EDIT



 /EDIT



 Invokes the ACL Editor and allows you to  use  the  /JOURNAL,  /KEEP,

  /MODE,  or /RECOVER qualifiers.  Any other qualifiers specified with

  /EDIT are ignored.



  For  more  information  on  the  ACL  Editor,  see  the  ACL  Editor

  description in the VAX/VMS Utilities Reference Volume.



/EXCLUDE


 /EXCLUDE=(file-spec[,...])



 Excludes any files that match the listed file  specification(s)  from

  the  SET  ACL operation.  Wildcard characters are not allowed in the

  file specification.  The file specification can contain a  directory

  specification;  however,  the  file  specification  cannot contain a

  device name.



  This qualifier cannot be used with  the  /EDIT  qualifier,  or  with

  /OBJECT_TYPE=DEVICE.



/JOURNAL


 /JOURNAL[=file-spec]

 /NOJOURNAL



  Controls whether a journal file is created from the editing session.

  By  default,  a  journal file is created if the editing session ends

  abnormally.



  If you omit the  file  specification,  the  journal  file  is  named

  input-file-spec.JOU  by default.  You can use the /JOURNAL qualifier

  to specify a journal file name that is different from  the  default.

  No  wildcard  characters  are  allowed  in  the  /JOURNAL  file-spec

  parameter.



  You must specify /EDIT in order to use this qualifier.



/KEEP


 /KEEP=(option[,...])



 Determines whether the journal file or  the  recovery  file  will  be

  deleted when the editing session ends.  The options are:



       JOURNAL Saves the journal file for current editing session

       RECOVER Saves the journal file used for restoring the ACL



  You can shorten the  keywords  JOURNAL  and  RECOVER  to  J  and  R,

  respectively.   If  you  specify  only  one option, you can omit the

  parentheses.



  You must specify /EDIT in order to use this qualifier.



/LIKE


 /LIKE=(OBJECT_TYPE=type,OBJECT_NAME=name)



 Indicates that the ACL  of  the  object-name  given  with  the  /LIKE

  qualifier  is to replace the ACL of the object(s) specified with SET

  ACL.  Any existing ACE (except those with the PROTECTED option) will

  be deleted before the ACL specified by /LIKE is copied.  The type of

  the source and destination objects do not have to be the same.



  You can specify two keywords for OBJECT_TYPE, DEVICE or  FILE.   The

  object-name  is  specified  as  it is specified for the command.  No

  wildcard characters are allowed in the /LIKE parameters.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/LOG



 /LOG

 /NOLOG



  Controls whether the SET ACL command displays the object name of the

  object  that  has  been affected by the command.  By default, no log

  information is displayed.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/MODE


 /MODE=[NO]PROMPT



 Determines whether the ACL  editor  prompts  for  field  values.   By

  default, the ACL editor selects prompt mode.



  You must specify the /EDIT qualifier to use this qualifier.



/NEW



 /NEW



 Indicates that any existing ACE in the ACL of object  specified  with

  SET  ACL  (except those with the PROTECTED option) is to be deleted.

  In order to use the /NEW qualifier, you must specify a  new  ACL  or

  ACE with the /ACL, /LIKE, or /REPLACE qualifier.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/OBJECT_TYPE


 /OBJECT_TYPE=type



 Defines the type of object that is to be  affected  by  the  SET  ACL

  command operation.  The following keywords are valid object types:



  FILE  The object is a Files-11 disk file.



  DEVICE The object is a device.



  By default, a  file  object  type  is  assumed,  and  therefore  the

  /OBJECT_TYPE=file need not be specified.



/RECOVER


 /RECOVER[=file-spec]

 /NORECOVER



  Specifies the name of the journal file to  be  used  in  a  recovery

  operation.   If  the  file specification is omitted with /RECOVER, a

  default  file  specification  of  input-file.JOU  is  assumed.    No

  wildcard   characters   are  allowed  with  the  /RECOVER  file-spec

  parameter.



  You must specify /EDIT in order to use this qualifier.



/REPLACE


 /REPLACE=(ace[,...])



 Deletes the access control entries (ACEs)  specified  with  the  /ACL

  qualifier and replaces them with those specified with /REPLACE.  Any

  ACEs specified with the  /ACL  qualifier  must  exist  and  must  be

  specified in the order in which they appear in the ACL.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/SINCE


 /SINCE[=time]



 Selects a file that is dated  after  the  specified  time.   You  can

  specify  either  an  absolute  time or a combination of absolute and

  delta times.   See  Section  2.5  in  the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary (or

  access  the  HELP   topic  SPECIFY)   for  complete  information  on

  specifying  time  values.   You  can  also  use  the keywords TODAY,

  TOMORROW, and YESTERDAY.  If no time is specified, TODAY is assumed.



  This qualifier cannot be used with  the  /EDIT  qualifier,  or  with

  /OBJECT_TYPE=DEVICE.

2 AUDIT
  Enables or disables security auditing on a VAX/VMS system.

  Format:

    SET AUDIT
3 Command_Qualifiers

/ALARM

 /ALARM

 Controls whether alarm messages are sent to all terminals enabled  as
  security   operators.   See  the  description  of  the  DCL  command
  REPLY/ENABLE for details on how  to  enable  terminals  as  security
  operators.   The  /ALARM  qualifier  must  be  used  with either the
  /ENABLE or /DISABLE qualifier.

/DISABLE

 /DISABLE=(keyword[,...])

 Indicates that one or more events should not result  in  any  action.
  The /DISABLE qualifier requires that the /ALARM also be specified.

  You can disable all events by specifying the keyword ALL, or you can
  selectively  disable  from  one  to  all  events  that are currently
  enabled by specifying  the  appropriate  keyword(s).   One  or  more
  keyword  is  required.   See the /ENABLE qualifier for a list of the
  keywords to use with /DISABLE.

  In processing the  SET  AUDIT  command,  the  system  processes  the
  /DISABLE  qualifier  last.   Thus,  if you accidentally specify both
  /ENABLE and /DISABLE in the same  command,  the  /DISABLE  qualifier
  prevails.

/ENABLE

 /ENABLE=(keyword[,...])

 Indicates that the particular event specified  in  the  keyword  list
  should  result  in some action.  The /ENABLE qualifier requires that
  the /ALARM qualifier also be specified.

  You can enable all events by specifying the keyword ALL, or you  can
  selectively enable from one to all events that are currently enabled
  by specifying the appropriate keyword(s).  One or  more  keyword  is
  required.

  The possible events that may be specified in  the  keyword  list  of
  either the /ENABLE or /DISABLE qualifiers are:

  ACL                        An event requested by an  Access  Control
                             List  (ACL)  item.   Access control lists
                             are described in  Section  3.7.2  in  the
                             VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary.

  ALL                        All possible events.

  AUTHORIZATION              The modification of any  portion  of  the
                             system or network user authorization file
                             (UAF).

  BREAKIN=(keyword[,...])    The occurrence of  one  or  more  of  the
                             following classes of breakin attempts, as

                             can  specify one or more of the following
                             keywords  to  describe  the  file  access
                             event to be noted.

  security  operators  for  any  change  in the system or network user
  authorization file and for any breakin attempts.

  2.   $ SET AUDIT/ALARM/DISABLE=ALL

  This command disables all alarms to security operators.
2 BROADCAST
  Enables you to selectively screen out various kinds of messages from
  being broadcast to your terminal.

  Format:

    SET BROADCAST=(class-name[,...])
3 Parameters

 class-name

  Specifies the class of message that you want to  enable  or  disable
  for  broadcast to your terminal.  If you specify only one class, you
  can omit the parentheses.  The class names are:

       ALL                        All message classes enabled

       [NO]DCL                    CTRL/T and SPAWN/NOTIFY messages

                                  group(s)
2 CARD_READER
  Defines the default translation mode for  cards  read  from  a  card
  reader.   All  subsequent  input read from the specified card reader
  will be converted using the specified mode.

  Format:

    SET CARD_READER device-name[:]
3 Parameters

 device-name[:]

  Specifies the name of the card reader for which the translation mode
  is  to  be  set.   The device must not be currently allocated to any
  other user.
3 Command_Qualifiers

/026

 /026

 Sets the card reader for cards punched on an 026 punch.

/029

 /029

 Sets the card reader for cards punched on an 029 punch.

/LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

  Controls whether log information is displayed  at  the  terminal  to
  confirm that the card reader is set.  By default, no log information
  is displayed.

3 Examples

  1.   $ ALLOCATE CR:
         _CRA0: ALLOCATED
       $ SET CARD_READER CRA0:/029
       $ COPY  CRA0: [MALCOLM.DATAFILES]CARDS.DAT

  The ALLOCATE command requests the allocation of  a  card  reader  by
  specifying  the  generic  device  name.   When  the ALLOCATE command
  displays the name of the device, the SET  CARD_READER  command  sets
  the  translation  mode at 029.  Then the COPY command copies all the
  cards read by the card reader CRA0 into the file  CARDS.DAT  in  the
  directory [MALCOLM.DATAFILES].
2 CLUSTER
  See HELP CLUSTER/QUORUM

3 /QUORUM
  Sets the cluster quorum to a value that you specify or, if no  value
  is  specified,  sets the cluster quorum to a value determined by the
  system.  The /QUORUM qualifier is required.

  Format:

    SET CLUSTER/QUORUM[=quorum-value]

4 Examples

  1.   $ SET CLUSTER/QUORUM

  This command instructs the system to calculate  the  cluster  quorum
  value  for  you,  since no value is specified as part of the command
  string.  The system will use the formula:  (V+2)/2, described above.

  2.   $ SET CLUSTER/QUORUM=9

  This command sets the cluster  quorum  to  9,  which  is  the  value
  specified in the command string.
2 COMMAND
  Invokes the Command Definition  Utility  to  add  commands  to  your
  process  command  table or to a specified command table file.  For a
  complete description of the Command  Definition  Utility,  including
  information about the SET COMMAND command, see the VAX/VMS Utilities
  Reference Volume.

  Format:

    SET COMMAND [file-spec[,...]]
3 Parameters

 [file-spec[,...]]

  Specifies the name of one or more command definition files.  If  you
  specify  more than one name, separate them with commas.  The default
  file type is CLD.  See the VAX/VMS Utilities  Reference  Volume  for
  more information about writing a command definition file.

  Wildcard characters are allowed in the file specification.
3 Command_Qualifiers

/DELETE

 /DELETE=(verb[,...])

 Specifies /DELETE mode to delete verbs from the command table you are
  modifying.

  You can use the /DELETE qualifier to delete a verb  in  either  your
  process  command table or in a command table file specified with the
  /TABLE qualifier.  If you do not use the /TABLE qualifier to specify
  an alternate command table, the default is to delete verbs from your
  process command table.  If you do not use the /OUTPUT  qualifier  to
  specify  an  output  file,  the  default  is  to return the modified
  command table to your process.

  The verb specifies a verb to be deleted.  If you specify two or more
  verbs,   separate   them   with  commas  and  enclose  the  list  in
  parentheses.  If you  specify  only  one  verb,  you  can  omit  the
  parentheses.

  You cannot use the /LISTING,  /OBJECT,  or  /REPLACE  qualifiers  in
  /DELETE mode.

/LISTING

 /LISTING[=file-spec]
 /NOLISTING

  Controls  whether  an  output  listing  is  created  and  optionally
  provides  an  output  file  specification  for  the listing file.  A
  listing file contains a listing of  the  command  definitions  along
  with  any error messages.  The listing file is similar to a compiler
  listing.

  If  you  specify  the  /LISTING  qualifier   and   omit   the   file
  specification,   output   is  written  to  the  default  device  and
  directory; the listing file will have the same  name  as  the  first
  command definition file and a file type of LIS.

  You can use the /LISTING qualifier only in /OBJECT or /REPLACE mode;
  you  cannot  create  a  listing  in  /DELETE  mode.   In /OBJECT and
  /REPLACE modes, the default is /NOLISTING.

/OBJECT

 /OBJECT[=file-spec]

 Specifies /OBJECT mode to create an  object  module  from  a  command
  definition   file   and   optionally   provides   an   object   file
  specification.  You cannot use the /OBJECT qualifier  to  create  an
  object  module  from  a  command  definition that contains the IMAGE
  keyword.

  You can specify only one command definition file when  you  use  SET
  COMMAND/OBJECT.

  If  you  specify  the  /OBJECT   qualifier   and   omit   the   file
  specification,   output   is  written  to  the  default  device  and
  directory; the object file will have the same name as the input file
  and a file type of OBJ.

  You cannot use the /DELETE, /OUTPUT, /REPLACE, or /TABLE  qualifiers
  in /OBJECT mode.

/OUTPUT

 /OUTPUT[=file-spec]
 /NOOUTPUT

  Controls where the modified command table should be placed.  If  you
  provide  an output file specification, the modified command table is
  written to the specified file.  If you do not provide an output file
  specification, the edited command table replaces your process table.
  The /NOOUTPUT qualifier indicates that no output is to be generated.

  You can specify  an  output  file  specification  with  the  /OUTPUT
  qualifier  only  when you also use the /TABLE=file-spec qualifier to
  provide the input tables.  The default file type is EXE.

  You can use the /OUTPUT qualifier only in /DELETE or /REPLACE  mode;
  you cannot use the /OUTPUT qualfier in /OBJECT mode.

  In /DELETE and /REPLACE mode, the default is /OUTPUT  with  no  file
  specification.

/REPLACE

 /REPLACE

 Specifies /REPLACE mode to add or replace verbs in the command  table
  you are modifying.

  You can use the /REPLACE qualifier  to  modify  either  the  process
  command  table  or  a  command  table file specified with the /TABLE
  qualifier.  If you do not use the /TABLE  qualifier  to  specify  an
  alternate  command  table,  the  default  is  to modify your process
  command table.  If you do not use the /OUTPUT qualifier  to  specify
  an  output file, the default is to return the modified command table
  to your process.

  You cannot use the /OBJECT or /DELETE qualifiers in /REPLACE mode.

  If you do not explicitly specify /DELETE, /OBJECT, or /REPLACE  mode
  the default is /REPLACE.

/TABLE

 /TABLE=[file-spec]

 Specifies the command table that is to be modified.  If  you  specify
  the  /TABLE  qualifier  and omit the file specification, the current
  process  command  table  is  modified.   If  you  include   a   file
  specification, the specified command table is modified.  The default
  file type is EXE.

  If you use the /TABLE qualifier to provide an  input  command  table
  file, you should also use the /OUTPUT qualifier to provide an output
  table file.  Otherwise, the modified command table will  be  written
  to your process and will replace your process command table.

  You can only use the /TABLE qualifier in /DELETE or  /REPLACE  mode;
  you cannot use the /TABLE qualfier in /OBJECT mode.

  In /REPLACE and /DELETE mode, the default is /TABLE  with  no  input
  file specification.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET COMMAND SNAG

  This command adds the commands in SNAG.CLD to the command  table  in
  the current process.

  2.   $ SET COMMAND/OBJECT SNAG

  This command creates an object file using the commands in  SNAG.CLD.
  This  object  file  can  then  be  linked with other object files to
  process application defined commands.

  3.   $ SET COMMAND/TABLE=MYTAB/OUTPUT=MYCLI SNAG

  This command adds the commands in  SNAG.CLD  to  the  command  table
  MYTAB.EXE and writes the updated table to MYCLI.EXE.

  When you use the /TABLE qualifier to specify an input command table,
  you  should  use the /OUTPUT qualifier to specify an an output file.
  Otherwise, your process command table will be overwritten.

  4.   $ SET COMMAND/DELETE=HOLD

  This command deletes the definition for  the  verb  HOLD  from  your
  process  command  table.   The modified command table is returned to
  your process.
2 CONTROL
  Determines whether control passes to the  command  interpreter  when
  CTRL/Y  is pressed and whether process statistics are displayed when
  CTRL/T is pressed.

  Format:

    SET [NO]CONTROL[=(T,Y)]
3 Parameters

 (T,Y)

  Specifies that one or  both  control  functions,  T  (CTRL/T)  or  Y
  (CTRL/Y), be enabled or disabled by the SET CONTROL command.  If you
  specify both control characters, separate  them  with  a  comma  and
  enclose  the list in parentheses.  By default, if you do not specify
  either control character (T or Y), only Y is assumed.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET NOCONTROL=Y

  The SET NOCONTROL command disables the CTRL/Y function  as  well  as
  most CTRL/C functions.

  2.   $ SET CONTROL=T

  The SET CONTROL command enables the CTRL/T function.

  3.   $ SET NOCONTROL=(T,Y)

  The SET NOCONTROL  command  disables  both  the  CTRL/T  and  CTRL/Y
  functions.
2 DAY
  Allows you to reset the default  day  type  specified  in  the  user
  authorization file (UAF) for the current day.

  Format:

    SET DAY
3 Command_Qualifiers

/DEFAULT

 /DEFAULT

 Overrides any previous SET DAY specification and specifies  that  the
  normal UAF defaults are to be used to determine today's day type.

/LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

  Controls whether log information is displayed  at  the  terminal  to
  confirm  that the new SET DAY information has been set.  By default,
  no log information is displayed.

/PRIMARY

 /PRIMARY

 Sets today until midnight to a primary day.

/SECONDARY

 /SECONDARY

 Sets today until midnight to a secondary day.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET DAY/PRIMARY

  This command overrides the current default day  type  and  sets  the
  today until midnight to a primary day.

  2.   $ SET DAY/DEFAULT

  This command overrides the previous SET DAY command and sets today's
  day type to the UAF-defined default.
2 DEFAULT
  Changes the default device and/or directory  name  for  the  current
  process.   The  new  default  is  applied  to  all  subsequent  file
  specifications that do not explicitly include a device or  directory
  name.

  When you change the default device assignment,  the  system  equates
  the specified device with the logical name SYS$DISK.

  Format:

    SET DEFAULT device-name[:]
3 Parameters

 device-name[:]

  Specifies a device and/or a directory name to be used as the default
  device or directory in file specifications.

  If you specify a physical device name,  terminate  the  device  name
  with  a colon.  If you specify a directory name, you must enclose it
  in square brackets.

  Generally,  the  SET  DEFAULT  command  performs  a   logical   name
  translation  on  the  entire  string  specified, not on the leftmost
  portion of the device name specified, as is  the  usual  case.   The
  translation is not iterative.

  When you use a search list logical name as the first element in  the
  SET  DEFAULT  parameter,  the  logical name is not translated by SET
  DEFAULT.  Instead, SET DEFAULT retains the logical name so that  RMS
  will  be  able  to  access the entire search list.  If you issue the
  SHOW DEFAULT command, the search list logical name will be displayed
  as  the  default  device.    See  Section 3.11  in  the  VAX/VMS DCL
  Dictionary for more information.

  You can  use  the  minus  sign  as  a  directory-searching  wildcard
  character in the directory specification.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET DEFAULT [CARPENTER]
       $ COPY A.* B.*

  The  SET  DEFAULT  command  changes   the   default   directory   to
  [CARPENTER].    The  default  disk  device  does  not  change.   The
  directory name [CARPENTER] is assumed to be  the  default  directory
  for subsequent file operations, such as the COPY command shown.

  2.   $ SET DEFAULT DISK2:

  The SET DEFAULT command changes the default disk  device  to  DISK2.
  The default directory name does not change.

  3.   $ SET DEFAULT DISK0:[CLARK]

  The SET DEFAULT command changes the default disk to  DISK0  and  the
  default directory name to CLARK.
2 DEVICE
  Establishes a print device  or  terminal  as  a  spooled  device  or
  establishes the status of error-logging for a device.

  Format:

    SET DEVICE device-name[:]
3 Parameters

 device-name[:]

  Specifies the name of the device  whose  spooling  or  error-logging
  status  is  to  change.   The  device  must  be  a print device or a
  terminal if its spooling status is to change; the device must  be  a
  disk or magnetic tape if its error-logging status is to change.

3 /ACL

  Allows you to modify the access control list (ACL) of a device.  The

  /ACL qualifier is required.



  Format:



    SET DEVICE/ACL[=(ace[,...])] device-name

4 Parameters



 device-name



  Specifies  a  device  whose  access  control  list  (ACL)  is  being

  modified.  Wildcard characters are not allowed in the device name.



 (ace[,...])



  Specifies one or more access control entries (ACEs) to be  modified.

  When  no  ACE  is  specified,  the  entire  access  control  list is

  affected.  Separate multiple ACEs with commas.  The  specified  ACEs

  are  inserted  at  the top of the ACL unless the /AFTER qualifier is

  given.

4 Command_Qualifiers



/AFTER


 /AFTER=ace



 Indicates that all access control entries (ACEs) specified  with  the

  /ACL qualifier will be added after the ACE specified with the /AFTER

  qualifier.  By default any ACEs added to the ACL are  always  placed

  at the top of the list.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/DELETE



 /DELETE



 Indicates that the access control entries (ACEs) specified  with  the

  /ACL  qualifier  are  to  be deleted.  If no ACEs are specified with

  /ACL, the entire ACL is deleted (except for ACEs with the  PROTECTED

  option).   If  you  specify an ACE that does not exist with the /ACL

  qualifier, you will be notified that the ACE does not exist and  the

  delete operation will continue.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/EDIT



 /EDIT



 Invokes the ACL Editor and allows you to  use  the  /JOURNAL,  /KEEP,

  /MODE,  or /RECOVER qualifiers.  Any other qualifiers specified with

  /EDIT are ignored.



  For  more  information  on  the  ACL  Editor,  see  the  ACL  Editor

  description in the VAX/VMS Utilities Reference Volume.



/JOURNAL


 /JOURNAL[=file-spec]

 /NOJOURNAL



  Controls whether a journal file is created from the editing session.

  By  default,  a  journal file is created if the editing session ends

  abnormally.



  If you omit the  file  specification,  the  journal  file  is  named

  input-file-spec.JOU  by default.  You can use the /JOURNAL qualifier

  to specify a journal file name that is different from  the  default.

  No  wildcard  characters  are  allowed  in  the  /JOURNAL  file-spec

  parameter.



  You must specify /EDIT in order to use this qualifier.



/KEEP


 /KEEP=(option[,...])



 Determines whether the journal file or  the  recovery  file  will  be

  deleted when the editing session ends.  The options are:



       JOURNAL Saves the journal file for current editing session

       RECOVER Saves the journal file used for restoring the ACL



  You can shorten the  keywords  JOURNAL  and  RECOVER  to  J  and  R,

  respectively.   If  you  specify  only  one option, you can omit the

  parentheses.



  You must specify /EDIT in order to use this qualifier.



/LIKE


 /LIKE=object-spec



 Indicates that the ACL of the object given with the  /LIKE  qualifier

  is  to  replace the ACL of the device specified with SET DEVICE/ACL.

  Any existing ACE (except those with the PROTECTED  option)  will  be

  deleted before the ACL specified by /LIKE is copied.



  No  wildcard  characters  are  allowed  in  the  /LIKE   device-name

  parameter.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/LOG



 /LOG

 /NOLOG



  Controls whether the SET DEVICE/ACL command displays the device name

  of the device that has been affected by the command.  By default, no

  log information is displayed.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/MODE


 /MODE=[NO]PROMPT



 Determines whether the ACL  editor  prompts  for  field  values.   By

  default, the ACL editor selects prompt mode.



  You must specify the /EDIT qualifier to use this qualifier.



/NEW



 /NEW



 Indicates that any existing ACE in the ACL of device  specified  with

  SET  DEVICE/ACL  (except  those  with the PROTECTED option) is to be

  deleted.  In order to use the /NEW qualifier, you must specify a new

  ACL or ACE with the /ACL, /LIKE, or /REPLACE qualifier.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/RECOVER


 /RECOVER[=file-spec]

 /NORECOVER



  Specifies the name of the journal file to  be  used  in  a  recovery

  operation.   If  the  file specification is omitted with /RECOVER, a

  default  file  specification  of  input-file.JOU  is  assumed.    No

  wildcard   characters   are  allowed  with  the  /RECOVER  file-spec

  parameter.



  You must specify /EDIT in order to use this qualifier.



/REPLACE


 /REPLACE=(ace[,...])



 Deletes the access control entries (ACEs)  specified  with  the  /ACL

  qualifier and replaces them with those specified with /REPLACE.  Any

  ACEs specified with the  /ACL  qualifier  must  exist  and  must  be

  specified in the order in which they appear in the ACL.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



4 Examples



  1.   $ SET DEVICE/ACL/LIKE=DOCD$ WRKD$



  This example replaces the ACL of WRKD$ with the ACL for  the  device

  DOCD$.


3 /AVAILABLE

 /AVAILABLE
 /NOAVAILABLE

  Controls whether the specified disk is to be  considered  available.
  This  command  can  be issued only after the specified disk has been
  dismounted.  If you specify /NOAVAILABLE, any attempt to  mount  the
  specified disk is prevented.

3 /DUAL_PORT

 /DUAL_PORT
 /NODUAL_PORT

  Controls whether the port seize logic in the device  driver  of  the
  specified disk is to be enabled.  This qualifier should be used only
  on disks that contain a dual port kit and have been dismounted.

3 /ERROR_LOGGING

 /ERROR_LOGGING
 /NOERROR_LOGGING

  Controls whether device errors are logged in  the  error  log  file.
  Use the SHOW DEVICE/FULL command to find out the current status.

3 /LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

  Controls whether log information will be displayed at the  terminal.
  By default, no information is displayed.

3 /SERVED

  Allows you to make a disk on a local node available to all the nodes

  in a cluster.  The /SERVED qualifier is required.



  Format:



    SET DEVICE/[NO]SERVED node-name$DDcu:

4 Parameters

  node-name$DDcu:



  Specifies the device name of  the  device  that  you  wish  to  make

  available to the cluster.





  Description



       The SET DEVICE/SERVED command is used in conjunction  with  the

       Mass Storage Control Protocol (MSCP) server to make a disk on a

       local node available to all nodes on the  cluster.   The  local

       node  must  be  a  member  of  a VAXCluster, and the local MSCP

       server must have been invoked by the SYSGEN utility.



                                    NOTE



               Unless the disk device that you intend to  make

               available  to  the cluster is a system disk, it

               must not already be mounted when you issue  the

               SET DEVICE/SERVED command.



       The SET DEVICE/SERVED command string can be included as part of

       the  local  startup  command  file, and issued before the MOUNT

       utility mounts the disk to be served  (made  available  to  the

       entire cluster).



4 Examples



  1.   $ SET DEVICE/SERVED DRA4:



  This command instructs the MSCP server to make the disk device DRA4:

  on  your  local  node  available  to  all  other  processors on your

  cluster.

3 /SPOOLED

 /SPOOLED[=(queue-name[:],intermediate-disk-name[:])]
 /NOSPOOLED

  Controls whether files will be spooled to an intermediate disk.

  The queue name indicates the  printer  queue  to  which  a  file  is
  queued.  If a queue name is not supplied, the default is the name of
  either the printer or terminal.

  The intermediate disk name identifies the disk to which the  spooled
  files  are  written.  If the intermediate disk name is not supplied,
  the  default  is  SYS$DISK  (the   current   default   disk).    The
  intermediate disk must be mounted before files can be written to it.

  Once the device has been set spooled to a disk, that disk cannot  be
  dismounted  until  the  spooled  device  is  set to /NOSPOOLED.  All
  channels must be deassigned from a print device before its  spooling
  characteristics can be changed.  Also, the queue that is assigned to
  the device must be stopped.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET DEVICE/SPOOLED=(LPA0)  LPA0:

  In this command, the /SPOOLED qualifier requests  that  the  printer
  queue  LPA0 be spooled to an intermediate disk before files directed
  to  the  disk  are  printed.   Because  no  intermediate  disk   was
  specified, the intermediate disk defaults to SYS$DISK.

  2.   $ SET DEVICE/ERROR_LOGGING  DBB2:

  This command requests that all device errors  reported  on  DBB2  be
  logged in the error log file.

  3.   $ SET DEVICE/NOAVAILABLE DRA0:

  This command prevents any attempt to mount a disk on DRA0.

  4.   $ SET DEVICE/DUAL_PORT DRA0:

  This command enables the dual port seize logic in DRA0.
2 DIRECTORY
  Modifies the characteristics of one or more directories.

  Format:

    SET DIRECTORY directory-spec[,...]
3 Parameters

 directory-spec[,...]

  Specifies one or more directories to be modified.  You must supply a
  complete  directory  specification  enclosed in square brackets.  If
  you specify two or more directories, separate them with commas.

  Wildcard characters are allowed in directory specifications.

3 /ACL

  Allows you to modify the access control list (ACL) of  one  or  more

  directory.  The /ACL qualifier is required.



  Format:



    SET DIRECTORY/ACL[=(ace[,...])] directory-spec[,...]

4 Parameters



 directory-spec[,...]



  Specifies one or more directories whose access control list (ACL) is

  being  modified.   Separate  multiple  directory specifications with

  commas.  Device name and colon are  optional.   Wildcard  characters

  are allowed in the directory specifications.  Each directory must be

  a disk directory on a Files-11 Structure Level 2 formatted volume.



  When the /EDIT qualifier is used, only one  directory  specification

  can be given and it cannot include any wildcard characters.



 (ace[,...])



  Specifies one or more access control entries (ACEs) to be  modified.

  When  no  ACE  is  specified,  the  entire  access  control  list is

  affected.  Separate multiple ACEs with commas.  The  specified  ACEs

  are  inserted  at  the top of the ACL unless the /AFTER qualifier is

  given.

4 Command_Qualifiers



/AFTER


 /AFTER=ace



 Indicates that all access control entries (ACEs) specified  with  the

  /ACL qualifier will be added after the ACE specified with the /AFTER

  qualifier.  By default any ACEs added to the ACL are  always  placed

  at the top of the list.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/BEFORE


 /BEFORE[=time]



 Selects only those directories that are dated  before  the  specified

  time.   You  can specify either an absolute time or a combination of

  absolute and  delta  times.   See  Section 2.5  in  the  VAX/VMS DCL

  Dictionary   (or  access  the  HELP  topic  SPECIFY)   for  complete

  information on  specifying  time  values.   You  can  also  use  the

  keywords TODAY, TOMORROW, and YESTERDAY.   If  no time is specified,

  TODAY is assumed.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/BY_OWNER


 /BY_OWNER[=uic]



 Selects one or more directory whose owner  user  identification  code

  (UIC)  matches  the specified owner UIC.  If the /BY_OWNER qualifier

  is specified without a UIC,  the  UIC  of  the  current  process  is

  assumed.



  Specify the UIC using standard UIC format as  described  in  Section

  3.7.1  in  the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary  (or  access  the  HELP  topic

  SPECIFY).



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/CONFIRM



 /CONFIRM

 /NOCONFIRM



  Controls whether a request is  issued  before  each  individual  SET

  DIRECTORY/ACL  operation  to  confirm  that  the operation should be

  performed on that directory.



  When the system  issues  the  prompt,  you  can  issue  any  of  the

  following responses:



       YES      NO     QUIT

       TRUE     FALSE  <CTRL/Z>

       1        0      ALL

                <RET>  



  You can use any combination of upper- and lowercase letters for word

  responses.  Word responses can be abbreviated to one or more letters

  (for example, T, TR, or TRU for TRUE).  Affirmative answers are YES,

  TRUE, and 1.  Negative answers are NO, FALSE, 0, and <RET>.  QUIT or

  <CTRL/Z> indicates that you want to stop processing the  command  at

  that  point.   When  you  respond with ALL, the command continues to

  process, but no further prompts are given.  If you type  a  response

  other than one of those in the list, the prompt will be reissued.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/CREATED



 /CREATED



 Selects directories based on their dates of creation.  This qualifier

  is relevant only when used with the /BEFORE or /SINCE qualifier.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/DEFAULT



 /DEFAULT



 Creates an ACL for the specified file(s) as if the  file  were  newly

  created.   For  a  directory file, the /DEFAULT qualifier propagates

  the entire ACL (except ACEs with the NOPROPAGATE option) so  that  a

  particular   access   protection  can  be  propagated  throughout  a

  directory  tree.   For  all  other  files,  the  /DEFAULT  qualifier

  propagates  the  DEFAULT  option  ACE(s)  in  the  ACL of the parent

  directory to the ACL of the specified file(s).



  The /DEFAULT qualifier uses the ACL of the parent directory  of  the

  specified  file,  not the current default directory.  This qualifier

  cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/DELETE



 /DELETE



 Indicates that the access control entries (ACEs) specified  with  the

  /ACL  qualifier  are  to  be deleted.  If no ACEs are specified with

  /ACL, the entire ACL is deleted (except for ACEs with the  PROTECTED

  option).   If  you  specify an ACE that does not exist with the /ACL

  qualifier, you will be notified that the ACE does not exist and  the

  delete operation will continue.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/EDIT



 /EDIT



 Invokes the ACL Editor and allows you to  use  the  /JOURNAL,  /KEEP,

  /MODE,  or /RECOVER qualifiers.  Any other qualifiers specified with

  /EDIT  are  ignored.   You  can  only  supply  one  directory   file

  specification with SET DIRECTORY/ACL/EDIT.



  For  more  information  on  the  ACL  Editor,  see  the  ACL  Editor

  description in the VAX/VMS Utilities Reference Volume.



/EXCLUDE


 /EXCLUDE=(directory-spec[,...])



 Excludes  any   directories   that   match   the   listed   directory

  specification(s)  from  the  SET  DIRECTORY/ACL  operation.   If you

  specify only one directory, you can omit the parentheses.   Wildcard

  characters   are  allowed  in  the  directory  specifications.   The

  directory specification cannot contain a device name.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/JOURNAL


 /JOURNAL[=file-spec]

 /NOJOURNAL



  Controls whether a journal file is created from the editing session.

  By  default,  a  journal file is created if the editing session ends

  abnormally.



  If you omit the  file  specification,  the  journal  file  is  named

  input-file-spec.JOU  by default.  You can use the /JOURNAL qualifier

  to specify a journal file name that is different from  the  default.

  No  wildcard  characters  are  allowed  in  the  /JOURNAL  file-spec

  parameter.



  You must specify /EDIT in order to use this qualifier.



/KEEP


 /KEEP=(option[,...])



 Determines whether the journal file or  the  recovery  file  will  be

  deleted when the editing session ends.  The options are:



       JOURNAL Saves the journal file for current editing session

       RECOVER Saves the journal file used for restoring the ACL



  You can shorten the  keywords  JOURNAL  and  RECOVER  to  J  and  R,

  respectively.   If  you  specify  only  one option, you can omit the

  parentheses.



  You must specify /EDIT in order to use this qualifier.



/LIKE


 /LIKE=object-spec



 Indicates that the ACL of the object given with the  /LIKE  qualifier

  is  to  replace  the  ACL  of  the  directories  specified  with SET

  DIRECTORY/ACL.  Any existing ACE (except those  with  the  PROTECTED

  option) will be deleted before the ACL specified by /LIKE is copied.



  No  wildcard  characters  are  allowed  in  the  /LIKE   object-spec

  parameter.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/LOG



 /LOG

 /NOLOG



  Controls  whether  the  SET  DIRECTORY/ACL  command   displays   the

  directory  specification of each directory that has been affected by

  the command.  By default, no log information is displayed.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/MODE


 /MODE=[NO]PROMPT



 Determines whether the ACL  editor  prompts  for  field  values.   By

  default, the ACL editor selects prompt mode.



  You must specify the /EDIT qualifier to use this qualifier.



/NEW



 /NEW



 Indicates that any existing ACE in the  ACL  of  directory  specified

  with  SET  DIRECTORY/ACL (except those with the PROTECTED option) is

  to be deleted.  In order to use the /NEW qualifier, you must specify

  a new ACL or ACE with the /ACL, /LIKE, or /REPLACE qualifier.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/RECOVER


 /RECOVER[=file-spec]

 /NORECOVER



  Specifies the name of the journal file to  be  used  in  a  recovery

  operation.   If  the  file specification is omitted with /RECOVER, a

  default  file  specification  of  input-file.JOU  is  assumed.    No

  wildcard   characters   are  allowed  with  the  /RECOVER  file-spec

  parameter.



  You must specify /EDIT in order to use this qualifier.



/REPLACE


 /REPLACE=(ace[,...])



 Deletes the access control entries (ACEs)  specified  with  the  /ACL

  qualifier and replaces them with those specified with /REPLACE.  Any

  ACEs specified with the  /ACL  qualifier  must  exist  and  must  be

  specified in the order in which they appear in the ACL.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



/SINCE


 /SINCE[=time]



 Selects only those directories that are  dated  after  the  specified

  time.   You  can specify either an absolute time or a combination of

  absolute and  delta  times.   See  Section 2.5  in  the  VAX/VMS DCL

  Dictionary   (or  access  the  HELP  topic  SPECIFY)   for  complete

  information  on  specifying  time  values.   You  can  also  use the

  keywords TODAY, TOMORROW, and YESTERDAY.   If  no time is specified,

  TODAY is assumed.



  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.



4 Examples



  1.   $ SET DIRECTORY/ACL/LIKE=[.USER] [.USER.CAPTIVE_ACCOUNTS]



  This example replaces the ACL of the directory CAPTIVE_ACCOUNTS with

  the ACL for the directory USER.LIS.


3 /BACKUP

 /BACKUP

 Selects directories according to  the  dates  of  their  most  recent
  backup.   This qualifier is relevant only when used with the /BEFORE
  or /SINCE qualifier.  Use of the /BACKUP qualifier  is  incompatible
  with /CREATED, /EXPIRED, and /MODIFIED.  The default is /CREATED.

3 /BEFORE

 /BEFORE[=time]

 Selects only those directories that are dated  before  the  specified
  time.

  You can specify either an absolute time or a combination of absolute
  and  delta  times.   See  Section 2.5  in the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary
  (or access the  HELP  topic  SPECIFY)  for  complete information  on  
  specifying  time  values.   You  can  also  use the keywords  TODAY, 
  TOMORROW, and YESTERDAY.  If no time is specified, TODAY is assumed.

3 /BY_OWNER

 /BY_OWNER[=uic]

 Specifies  that  only  those  directories  which  are  owned  by  the
  specified user identification code (UIC) will be modified.

  Specify the UIC using standard UIC format as  described  in  Section
  3.7.1  in  the  VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary  (or  access  the  HELP topic 
  SPECIFY).

  If the /BY_OWNER qualifier is specified without a UIC,  the  UIC  of
  the current process is assumed.

3 /CONFIRM

 /CONFIRM
 /NOCONFIRM

  Controls whether the SET DIRECTORY command  displays  the  directory
  specification of each directory before modifying it and requests you
  to confirm that the operation should be performed on that directory.

  When the system  issues  the  prompt,  you  can  issue  any  of  the
  following responses:

       YES      NO     QUIT
       TRUE     FALSE  <CTRL/Z>
       1        0      ALL
                <RET>  

  You can use any combination of upper- and lowercase letters for word
  responses.  Word responses can be abbreviated to one or more letters
  (for example, T, TR, or TRU for TRUE).  Affirmative answers are YES,
  TRUE, and 1.  Negative answers are NO, FALSE, 0, and <RET>.  QUIT or
  <CTRL/Z> indicates that you want to stop processing the  command  at
  that  point.   When  you  respond with ALL, the command continues to
  process, but no further prompts are given.  If you type  a  response
  other than one of those in the list, the prompt will be reissued.

3 /CREATED

 /CREATED

 Selects directories based on their dates of creation.  This qualifier
  is  relevant  only  when  used with the /BEFORE or /SINCE qualifier.
  Use  of  the  /CREATED  qualifier  is  incompatible  with   /BACKUP,
  /EXPIRED, and /MODIFIED.  The default is /CREATED.

3 /EXCLUDE

 /EXCLUDE=(directory-spec[,...])

 Any directories that match the listed directory specification(s)  are
  excluded from the SET DIRECTORY operation.

  Wildcard characters are allowed in the directory specifications.  If
  you  specify  only  one  directory,  you  can  omit the parentheses.
  However, you  cannot  include  the  device  name  in  the  directory
  specification(s) you supply with the /EXCLUDE qualifier.

3 /EXPIRED

 /EXPIRED

 Selects directories according to the dates on which they will expire.
  This qualifier is relevant only when used with the /BEFORE or /SINCE
  qualifier.  Use of  the  /EXPIRED  qualifier  is  incompatible  with
  /BACKUP, /CREATED, and /MODIFIED.  The default is /CREATED.

3 /LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

  Controls whether the SET DIRECTORY command  displays  the  directory
  specification  of  each  directory that is modified.  The default is
  /NOLOG.

3 /MODIFIED

 /MODIFIED

 Selects directories according to the dates on which  they  were  last
  modified.   This  qualifier  is  only  relevant  when  used with the
  /BEFORE or /SINCE qualifier.  Use  of  the  /MODIFIED  qualifier  is
  incompatible  with  /BACKUP, /CREATED, and /EXPIRED.  The default is
  /CREATED.

3 /OWNER_UIC

 /OWNER_UIC[=uic]

 Sets the owner user identification code (UIC) of the directory to the
  specified  UIC.   Specify  the  UIC  using  standard  UIC  format as
  described in Section 3.7.1 in the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary  (or access
  the HELP topic SPECIFY).

  You must have SYSPRV (system privilege) to use this qualifier.

3 /SINCE

 /SINCE[=time]

 Selects only those directories that are  dated  after  the  specified
  time.

  You can specify either an absolute time or a combination of absolute
  and  delta  times.   See  Section 2.5 in the  VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary 
  (or access  the HELP topic SPECIFY)  for   complete  information  on
  specifying  time  values.   You  can  also use the  keywords  TODAY, 
  TOMORROW, and YESTERDAY.  If no time is specified, TODAY is assumed.

3 /VERSION_LIMIT

 /VERSION_LIMIT[=n]

 Specifies the total number of versions that a file in  the  specified
  directory  can have.  If you do not specify a version limit, a value
  of 0 is used, implying that the number of  versions  of  a  file  is
  limited only to the Files-11 architectural limit---32767.

  If you change the version limit for the  directory,  the  new  value
  only  applies  to files created after the change has been made.  The
  new limit does not apply to  new  versions  of  files  that  existed
  before  the  change.   The  limits that apply to those files are the
  same as the limits for the initial versions of the files.

  The SET DIRECTORY version limit value refers to the number of  files
  with  the same file name and type that can exist in the directory at
  one time.  It has no  effect  on  the  version  number  field  of  a
  particular  file  specification.   Use  the  SET FILE command to set
  limits on file version numbers.

  To find out what the current version limit is for a  directory,  you
  must  use the DUMP/HEADER command.  Specify the /FORMATTED qualifier
  to format the output and  the  /BLOCKS=COUNT:0  qualifier  to  avoid
  dumping the entire directory contents.  For example,

       DUMP/HEADER/FORMATTED/BLOCKS=COUNT:0 directory-spec

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET DIRECTORY/VERSION_LIMIT=5/CONFIRM [SMITH.FORTRAN]

  The SET DIRECTORY command limits to five the number of versions  for
  files  created  after the command is issued.  The /CONFIRM qualifier
  requests that you confirm whether or  not  the  specified  directory
  should actually be modified.

  2.   $ SET DIRECTORY/OWNER_UIC=[360,020] [DAVIDSON],[USERS]

  The SET DIRECTORY command modifies both the [DAVIDSON]  and  [USERS]
  directories,  changing  their  owner  UICs.   Use  of  the OWNER_UIC
  qualifier requires SYSPRV (system privilege).
2 FILE
  Modifies the characteristics of one or more files.

  o  Modify the access control list (ACL) of one or  more  files  (see
     /ACL).

  Format:

    SET FILE file-spec[,...]
3 Parameters

 file-spec[,...]

  Specifies one or more files to be modified.  If you specify  two  or
  more files, separate them with commas.

  Wildcard characters are allowed in the file specifications.
3 Command_Qualifiers

/ACL

 /ACL

 Modifies an Access Control List (ACL) associated  with  one  or  more
  files.   For  more  information,  see  the  description  of  the SET
  FILE/ACL command.

/BACKUP

 /BACKUP
 /NOBACKUP

  Controls whether the BACKUP command will back up the contents of the
  specified  file(s).   This  qualifier  is  valid  only  for Files-11
  Structure Level 2 files.

  If you specify /NOBACKUP, BACKUP will record the attributes  of  the
  file  but  not  the  data  in  the file.  The /NOBACKUP qualifier is
  useful for saving files  that  contain  unimportant  data,  such  as
  SWAPFILES.

/BEFORE

 /BEFORE[=time]

 Selects only those files that are dated before the specified time.

  You can specify either an absolute time or a combination of absolute
  and  delta  times.   See  Section 2.5 in the  VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary 
  (or access the HELP  topic  SPECIFY)  for  complete  information  on  
  specifying  time  values.   You  can  also  use  the keywords TODAY, 
  TOMORROW, and YESTERDAY.  If no time is specified, TODAY is assumed.

/BY_OWNER

 /BY_OWNER[=uic]

 Selects one or more files only if  their  owner  user  identification
  code (UIC) matches the specified owner UIC.

  Specify the UIC using standard UIC format as  described  in  Section
  3.7.1  in  the  VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary  (or access  the  HELP  topic 
  SPECIFY).

  If the /BY_OWNER qualifier is specified without a UIC,  the  UIC  of
  the current process is assumed.

/CONFIRM

 /CONFIRM
 /NOCONFIRM

  Controls whether a request is issued before each individual SET FILE
  operation  to confirm that the operation should be performed on that
  file.

  When the system  issues  the  prompt,  you  can  issue  any  of  the
  following responses:

       YES      NO     QUIT
       TRUE     FALSE  <CTRL/Z>
       1        0      ALL
                <RET>  

  You can use any combination of upper- and lowercase letters for word
  responses.  Word responses can be abbreviated to one or more letters
  (for example, T, TR, or TRU for TRUE).  Affirmative answers are YES,
  TRUE, and 1.  Negative answers are NO, FALSE, 0, and <RET>.  QUIT or
  <CTRL/Z> indicates that you want to stop processing the  command  at
  that  point.   When  you  respond with ALL, the command continues to
  process, but no further prompts are given.  If you type  a  response
  other than one of those in the list, the prompt will be reissued.

/CREATED

 /CREATED

 Selects files based on their dates of creation.   This  qualifier  is
  relevant only when used with the /BEFORE or /SINCE qualifier.

/DATA_CHECK

 /DATA_CHECK[=([NO]READ,[NO]WRITE)]

 Specifies  whether  a  READ  data  check,  WRITE  data  check,  or  a
  combination  of  the  two is performed on the file during transfers.
  If you do not specify either READ or WRITE, a WRITE  data  check  is
  performed on the file by default.

/END_OF_FILE

 /END_OF_FILE

 Resets the end-of-file mark to the highest block allocated.

/ENTER

 /ENTER=new-file-spec

 Enables you to assign an additional name to a file.  The file now has
  a  second  name,  or alias, but both the original name and the alias
  reference the same file.  For this reason, care should be taken when
  deleting  files  which  have aliases.  In order to keep the file but
  remove one of its names, use the /REMOVE qualifier with SET FILE.

  No wildcards are allowed in the file specification.

  Use of the /ENTER qualifier is discouraged.

/ERASE_ON_DELETE

 /ERASE_ON_DELETE

 Specifies that the specified file(s) will be  erased  from  the  disk
  (not  just  merely  written  over)  when a command such as DELETE or
  PURGE  is  issued  for  the  file(s).   See  DELETE/ERASE  for  more
  information.

/EXCLUDE

 /EXCLUDE=(file-spec[,...])

 Any files that match the listed file  specification(s)  are  excluded
  from  the SET FILE operation.  If you specify only one file, you can
  omit the parentheses.

  Wildcard characters are allowed in  the  file  specifications.   The
  file  specification can contain a directory specification.  However,
  you cannot include the  device  in  the  file  specification(s)  you
  supply with the /EXCLUDE qualifier.

/EXPIRATION_DATE

 /EXPIRATION_DATE=date
 /NOEXPIRATION_DATE

 Controls  whether an expiration date is  assigned  to  the  specified
  file(s).   Specify  the  date  according  to  the rules described in
  Section 2.5 in the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary (or access  the HELP topic 
  SPECIFY).  Absolute date keywords are allowed.  If  you specify 0 as 
  the date, today's date is used.

/EXTENSION

 /EXTENSION[=n]

 Sets the default extend quantity for the file.   You  can  specify  a
  value  from  0  to  65535.   If  you omit the value specification or
  specify a value of 0, VAX RMS calculates its own /EXTENSION value.

  See  the  SET  RMS_DEFAULT  command  for  a   description   of   the
  /EXTEND_QUANTITY qualifier.

/GLOBAL_BUFFER

 /GLOBAL_BUFFER=n

 Specifies the VAX RMS global buffer count for the specified  file(s).
  Specify a number (n) in the range of 0 through 32767 to indicate the
  number of buffers that can be  shared  by  processes  accessing  the
  file.

  A value of 0 disables buffer sharing.

/LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

  Controls  whether  the  SET   FILE   command   displays   the   file
  specification of each file after the modification is made.

  By default, the SET FILE command does not display the names  of  the
  files after they are modified.

/NODIRECTORY

 /NODIRECTORY

 Specifies that the file specification does not refer to a  directory.
  You  can  use the /NODIRECTORY qualifier when you are using wildcard
  characters  in  the  file  specification(s)  to   ensure   that   no
  directories  are  affected  by the command.  This qualifier is valid
  only for the Files-11 Structure Level-2 files.

/OWNER_UIC

 /OWNER_UIC[=uic]

 Sets the owner user identification code (UIC)  of  the  file  to  the
  specified  UIC.  You must have system privilege (SYSPRV) in order to
  use the /OWNER_UIC qualifier.

  Specify the UIC using standard UIC format as  described  in  Section
  3.7.1  in  the  VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary  (or access  the  HELP  topic 
  SPECIFY).

/PROTECTION

 /PROTECTION[=(code)]

 Enables you to change or reset the protection for one or more of your
  files.   If  no  protection  code  is  specified,  the access of the
  specified file(s) is set to the current default protection.

  For more information on specifying the protection code, see  Section
  3.7 in the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary.

/REMOVE

 /REMOVE

 Enables you to remove one of the names of a file that has  more  than
  one  name,  without  deleting  the  file.   If  you  have created an
  additional name for a file with the /ENTER qualifier  of  SET  FILE,
  you can use the /REMOVE qualifier to remove either the original name
  or the alias.  The file still exists and can be accessed by whatever
  name or names remain in effect.

  If you accidentally remove the name of a  file  that  has  only  one
  name,  you  will  not  be  able  to  access  that file with most DCL
  commands.  Use the ANALYZE/DISK_STRUCTURE utility  to  retrieve  the
  file.

  Use of this qualifier is discouraged.

/SINCE

 /SINCE[=time]

 Selects only those files that are dated after the specified time.

  You can specify either an absolute time or a combination of absolute
  and  delta  times.   See  Section 2.5 in the  VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary 
  (or access the HELP  topic  SPECIFY)  for  complete  information  on  
  specifying  time  values.   You  can  also  use the  keywords TODAY, 
  TOMORROW, and YESTERDAY.  If no time is specified, TODAY is assumed.

/UNLOCK

 /UNLOCK

 Requests that one or more files be unlocked.  A locked file is a file
  which  has become inaccessible as a result of having been improperly
  closed.

/TRUNCATE

 /TRUNCATE

 Requests that the file is to be truncated at the  end  of  the  block
  containing the end-of-file (EOF) mark.

/VERSION_LIMIT

 /VERSION_LIMIT[=n]

 Specifies the maximum number of versions a file can have.  If you  do
  not specify a version limit, a value of 0 is used, implying that the
  number of versions of  a  file  is  limited  only  to  the  Files-11
  architectural limit, 32767.  When you create a new version of a file
  that would cause the version limit  to  be  exceeded,  the  earliest
  version is deleted from the directory.

  When the /VERSION_LIMIT qualifier is in effect, only one version  of
  a  file is deleted each time a new file is created.  For example, if
  you set the version limit to 3 when there are already five  versions
  of  that  file  in  your  directory,  there will continue to be five
  versions of the file unless you specifically delete  some  or  purge
  the directory.  Once the number of versions is equal to or less than
  the current version limit, the version limit will be maintained.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET FILE/EXPIRATION_DATE=15-APR-1984:11:00 BATCH.COM;3

  The SET FILE command requests that the expiration date of  the  file
  BATCH.COM;3 be set to 11:00 A.M., April 15, 1984.

  2.   $ SET FILE/BEFORE=15-APR-84/ERASE_ON_DELETE PERSONNEL*.SAL

  This SET FILE command calls  for  all  files  that  match  the  file
  specification  PERSONNEL*.SAL  and  that  are dated before April 15,
  1984 to have their disk locations erased whenever  one  of  them  is
  deleted with commands such as DELETE or PURGE.

  3.   $ SET FILE/OWNER_UIC=[360,020]/VERSION_LIMIT=100 MYFILE.DAT

  The SET FILE  command  modifies  the  characteristics  of  the  file
  MYFILE.DAT,  changing  the  owner  UIC  and assigning a file version
  limit of 100.  Note that you must have system privilege (SYSPRV)  in
  order to change the owner UIC.
3 /ACL
  Allows you to modify the access control list (ACL) of  one  or  more
  files.  The /ACL qualifier is required.

  Format:

    SET FILE/ACL[=(ace[,...])] file-spec[,...]
4 Parameters

 file-spec[,...]

  Specifies one or more files whose access control list (ACL) is being
  modified.    Separate  multiple  file  specifications  with  commas.
  Wildcard characters are allowed in the  file  specifications.   Each
  file  must  be a disk file on a Files-11 Structure Level 2 formatted
  volume.

  When the /EDIT qualifier is used, only one file specification can be
  given and it cannot include any wildcard characters.

 (ace[,...])

  Specifies one or more access control entries (ACEs) to be  modified.
  When  no  ACE  is  specified,  the  entire  access  control  list is
  affected.  Separate multiple ACEs with commas.  The  specified  ACEs
  are  inserted  at  the top of the ACL unless the /AFTER qualifier is
  given.
4 Command_Qualifiers

/AFTER

 /AFTER=ace

 Indicates that all access control entries (ACEs) specified  with  the
  /ACL qualifier will be added after the ACE specified with the /AFTER
  qualifier.  By default any ACEs added to the ACL are  always  placed
  at the top of the list.

  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.

/BEFORE

 /BEFORE[=time]

 Selects only those files that are dated before  the  specified  time.
  You can specify either an absolute time or a combination of absolute
  and delta times.  See Section 2.5 in  the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary (or 
  access   the  HELP  topic  SPECIFY)   for  complete  information  on  
  specifying  time  values.   You  can  also  use the keywords  TODAY,  
  TOMORROW, and YESTERDAY.  If no time is specified, TODAY is assumed.

  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.

/BY_OWNER

 /BY_OWNER[=uic]

 Selects one or more files whose owner user identification code  (UIC)
  matches  the  specified  owner  UIC.   If the /BY_OWNER qualifier is
  specified without a UIC, the UIC of the current process is assumed.

  Specify the UIC using standard UIC format as  described  in  Section
  3.7.1  in  the  VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary  (or  access  the  HELP topic 
  SPECIFY).

  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.

/CONFIRM

 /CONFIRM
 /NOCONFIRM

  Controls whether a request is  issued  before  each  individual  SET
  FILE/ACL operation to confirm that the operation should be performed
  on that file.

  When the system  issues  the  prompt,  you  can  issue  any  of  the
  following responses:

       YES      NO     QUIT
       TRUE     FALSE  <CTRL/Z>
       1        0      ALL
                <RET>  

  You can use any combination of upper- and lowercase letters for word
  responses.  Word responses can be abbreviated to one or more letters
  (for example, T, TR, or TRU for TRUE).  Affirmative answers are YES,
  TRUE, and 1.  Negative answers are NO, FALSE, 0, and <RET>.  QUIT or
  <CTRL/Z> indicates that you want to stop processing the  command  at
  that  point.   When  you  respond with ALL, the command continues to
  process, but no further prompts are given.  If you type  a  response
  other than one of those in the list, the prompt will be reissued.

  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.

/CREATED

 /CREATED

 Selects files based on their dates of creation.   This  qualifier  is
  relevant only when used with the /BEFORE or /SINCE qualifier.

  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.

/DEFAULT

 /DEFAULT

 Creates an ACL for the specified file(s) as if the  file  were  newly
  created.   For  a  directory file, the /DEFAULT qualifier propagates
  the entire ACL (except ACEs with the NOPROPAGATE option) so  that  a
  particular   access   protection  can  be  propagated  throughout  a
  directory  tree.   For  all  other  files,  the  /DEFAULT  qualifier
  propagates  the  DEFAULT  option  ACE(s)  in  the  ACL of the parent
  directory to the ACL of the specified file(s).

  The /DEFAULT qualifier uses the ACL of the parent directory  of  the
  specified  file,  not the current default directory.  This qualifier
  cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.

/DELETE

 /DELETE

 Indicates that the access control entries (ACEs) specified  with  the
  /ACL  qualifier  are  to  be deleted.  If no ACEs are specified with
  /ACL, the entire ACL is deleted (except for ACEs with the  PROTECTED
  option).   If  you  specify an ACE that does not exist with the /ACL
  qualifier, you will be notified that the ACE does not exist and  the
  delete operation will continue.

  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.

/EDIT

 /EDIT

 Invokes the ACL Editor and allows you to  use  the  /JOURNAL,  /KEEP,
  /MODE,  or /RECOVER qualifiers.  Any other qualifiers specified with
  /EDIT are ignored.  You can only supply one file specification  with
  SET FILE/ACL/EDIT.

  For  more  information  on  the  ACL  Editor,  see  the  ACL  Editor
  description in the VAX/VMS Utilities Reference Volume.

/EXCLUDE

 /EXCLUDE=(file-spec[,...])

 Excludes any files that match the listed file  specification(s)  from
  the  SET  FILE/ACL operation.  If you specify only one file, you can
  omit the parentheses.  Wildcard characters are allowed in  the  file
  specifications.   The  file  specification  can  contain a directory
  specification; however, the  file  specification  cannot  contain  a
  device name.

  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.

/JOURNAL

 /JOURNAL[=file-spec]
 /NOJOURNAL

  Controls whether a journal file is created from the editing session.
  By  default,  a  journal file is created if the editing session ends
  abnormally.

  If you omit the  file  specification,  the  journal  file  is  named
  input-file-spec.JOU  by default.  You can use the /JOURNAL qualifier
  to specify a journal file name that is different from  the  default.
  No  wildcard  characters  are  allowed  in  the  /JOURNAL  file-spec
  parameter.

  You must specify /EDIT in order to use this qualifier.

/KEEP

 /KEEP=(option[,...])

 Determines whether the journal file or  the  recovery  file  will  be
  deleted when the editing session ends.  The options are:

       JOURNAL Saves the journal file for current editing session
       RECOVER Saves the journal file used for restoring the ACL

  You can shorten the  keywords  JOURNAL  and  RECOVER  to  J  and  R,
  respectively.   If  you  specify  only  one option, you can omit the
  parentheses.

  You must specify /EDIT in order to use this qualifier.

/LIKE

 /LIKE=file-spec

 Indicates that the ACL of the file given with the /LIKE qualifier  is
  to  replace the ACL of the file(s) specified with SET FILE/ACL.  Any
  existing ACE (except  those  with  the  PROTECTED  option)  will  be
  deleted before the ACL specified by /LIKE is copied.

  No wildcard characters are allowed in the /LIKE file-spec parameter.

  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.

/LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

  Controls  whether  the  SET  FILE/ACL  command  displays  the   file
  specification  of  each  file that has been affected by the command.
  By default, no log information is displayed.

  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.

/MODE

 /MODE=[NO]PROMPT

 Determines whether the ACL  editor  prompts  for  field  values.   By
  default, the ACL editor selects prompt mode.

  You must specify the /EDIT qualifier to use this qualifier.

/NEW

 /NEW

 Indicates that any existing ACE in the ACL of file specified with SET
  FILE/ACL  (except those with the PROTECTED option) is to be deleted.
  In order to use the /NEW qualifier, you must specify a  new  ACL  or
  ACE with the /ACL, /LIKE, or /REPLACE qualifier.

  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.

/RECOVER

 /RECOVER[=file-spec]
 /NORECOVER

  Specifies the name of the journal file to  be  used  in  a  recovery
  operation.   If  the  file specification is omitted with /RECOVER, a
  default  file  specification  of  input-file.JOU  is  assumed.    No
  wildcard   characters   are  allowed  with  the  /RECOVER  file-spec
  parameter.

  You must specify /EDIT in order to use this qualifier.

/REPLACE

 /REPLACE=(ace[,...])

 Deletes the access control entries (ACEs)  specified  with  the  /ACL
  qualifier and replaces them with those specified with /REPLACE.  Any
  ACEs specified with the  /ACL  qualifier  must  exist  and  must  be
  specified in the order in which they appear in the ACL.

  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.

/SINCE

 /SINCE[=time]

 Selects only those files that are dated  after  the  specified  time.
  You can specify either an absolute time or a combination of absolute
  and delta times.  See Section 2.5 in  the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary (or 
  access   the  HELP  topic  SPECIFY)   for  complete  information  on  
  specifying  time  values.   You  can  also  use the keywords  TODAY,  
  TOMORROW, and YESTERDAY.  If no time is specified, TODAY is assumed.

  This qualifier cannot be used with the /EDIT qualifier.

4 Examples

  1.   $ SET FILE/ACL/LIKE=USER.LIS CAPTIVE_ACCOUNTS.LIS

  This example replaces the ACL of the file CAPTIVE_ACCOUNTS.LIS  with
  the ACL for the file USER.LIS.
2 HOST
  Connects your terminal  (through  the  current  host  processor)  to
  another  processor,  called  the  remote processor.  Both processors
  must be running DECnet.

  Format:

    SET HOST node-name
3 Parameters

 node-name

  Specifies the node name of the remote processor.
3 /DTE
  Connects your system to a remote system via  an  out-going  terminal
  line.

  Format:

    SET HOST/DTE terminal-name
4 Parameters

 terminal-name

  Specifies the name of an out-going  terminal  line,  which  connects
  your system either directly to another system, or to a modem.
4 Command_Qualifier

/DIAL

 /DIAL=(NUMBER:number[,MODEM_TYPE:modem-type])

 Allows a  modem  attached  to  the  out-going  terminal  line  to  be
  autodialed  using  the autodial protocol of that modem.  The NUMBER:
  parameter is required and must be followed by the  telephone  number
  that is to be autodialed.

  The optional MODEM_TYPE:  parameter may be used to specify  a  modem
  type  other  than  a  DF03  (the default modem-type).  A template is
  provided for users interested in  supporting  non-DF03  modems  with
  autodial capabilities (See SYS$EXAMPLES:DTE_DF03.MAR).

4 Examples

  1.   $ SET HOST/DTE TTA2:/DIAL=NUMBER:5551234
       Username:  SMITH
       Password:

  This  SET  HOST/DTE  command  connects  the  user  terminal  to  the
  out-going  terminal  line  TTA2:, which is attached to a modem (type
  DF03 by default) set to autodial to the phone number 555-1234.   The
  remote  processor  then prompts for user name and password.  Use the
  normal login procedure to log in to the remote system.
3 /LOG

 /LOG[=file-spec]
 /NOLOG

  Controls whether a log file of the entire session is kept.   If  you
  use  /LOG  without  the  file  specification, the log information is
  stored in the file SETHOST.LOG.

  By default, no log of the terminal session is kept.
3 /X29
  Enables connection to a host-based Packet Assembler/Disassembler 
  (PAD) using the X29 protocol.

  Format:

  SET HOST/X29 node-name


  This is a facility of the VAX Packetnet Switching Interface (PSI)
  product, which is available under separate license.

  If you have VAX PSI installed, you can obtain further on-line help 
  under the topic, PSI.
    
  By default, no connection to a PAD is made.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET HOST ALBANY
       Username:  SMITH
       Password:

  This SET HOST command connects the user terminal to the processor at
  the  network  node  named ALBANY.  The remote processor then prompts
  for user name and password.  Use the normal login procedure  to  log
  in to the remote processor.
2 KEY
  Changes the current key definition state.  Keys are defined  by  the
  DEFINE/KEY command.

  Format:

    SET KEY
3 Command_Qualifiers

/LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

  Controls whether the system displays a message indicating  that  the
  key state has been set.  The default is /LOG.

/STATE

 /STATE=state-name
 /NOSTATE

  Specifies the state for the system to set.  The state  name  can  be
  any  alphanumeric  string.   If you omit the /STATE qualifier or use
  /NOSTATE, the current state is left unchanged.  The default state is
  DEFAULT.
2 LOGINS
  Sets a limit on the number of users  who  can  gain  access  to  the
  operating   system.    This   command   also  displays  the  current
  interactive level as described below.

  Format:

    SET LOGINS
3 Command_Qualifier

/INTERACTIVE

 /INTERACTIVE[=n]

 Establishes the number of interactive users allowed to gain access to
  the  system.   When  you do not supply a value for the n, SET LOGINS
  displays the current status of the login quotas.

3 Examples
2 MAGTAPE
  Defines the  default  characteristics  associated  with  a  specific
  magnetic tape device for subsequent file operations.

  Format:

    SET MAGTAPE device-name[:]
3 Parameters

 device-name[:]

  Specifies the name  of  the  magnetic  tape  device  for  which  the
  characteristics are to be set.

  The device must not be currently allocated to any other user.
3 Command_Qualifiers

/DENSITY

 /DENSITY=density

 Specifies the default density, in bits per inch (bpi), for all  write
  operations on the magnetic tape device when the volume is mounted as
  a foreign tape  or  as  an  unlabeled  tape.   The  density  can  be
  specified  as  800, 1600, or 6250, if supported by the magnetic tape
  drive.

/END_OF_FILE

 /END_OF_FILE

 Writes a tape mark at the  current  position  on  the  magnetic  tape
  volume.

/LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

  Displays information about the operations performed on the  magnetic
  tape volume.

/LOGSOFT

 /LOGSOFT
 /NOLOGSOFT

  Controls whether soft errors on  the  specified  device  are  to  be
  logged  in  the  error  log  file.   Soft errors are errors that are
  corrected by  the  hardware  without  software  intervention.   This
  qualifier   only   affects   devices  that  support  hardware  error
  correction, such as the TU78 magnetic tape drive.   When  used  with
  other devices, this qualifier has no effect.

/REWIND

 /REWIND

 Requests that the volume on the specified device be  rewound  to  the
  beginning of the magnetic tape.

/SKIP

 /SKIP=option

 Requests that the magnetic tape volume be positioned according to any
  of the following options:

  BLOCK:n      Directs the SET MAGTAPE command to skip  the  specified
               number of blocks

  END_OF_TAPE  Directs the SET MAGTAPE command to position the  volume
               at the end-of-tape mark

  FILES:n      Directs the SET MAGTAPE command to skip  the  specified
               number of files

  RECORD:n     Directs the SET MAGTAPE command to skip  the  specified
               number of records

/UNLOAD

 /UNLOAD

 Requests that the volume on  the  specified  device  be  rewound  and
  unloaded.

3 Examples

  1.   $ MOUNT MTB1:/FOREIGN
       $ SET MAGTAPE MTB1: /DENSITY=800

  The MOUNT command mounts a foreign tape on the device MTB1.  The SET
  MAGTAPE command defines the density for writing the magnetic tape at
  800 bpi.

  2.   $ MOUNT MTA0:/FOREIGN
       $ SET MAGTAPE MTA0:/SKIP=FILES:4

  The MOUNT command mounts a foreign tape on the device MTA0; the  SET
  MAGTAPE  command  directs  the  magnetic  tape position to skip four
  files.
2 MESSAGE
  Permits you to specify the display format of messages or to override
  or supplement the system messages.

  Format:

    SET MESSAGE [file-spec]
3 Parameters

 file-spec

  Specifies an optional message file.  If the file specification  does
  not contain a file type, the default type is EXE.

  No wildcard characters are allowed in the file specification.
3 Command_Qualifiers

/DELETE

 /DELETE

 Removes  the  currently  selected  process  message  file  from  your
  process.   Do  not  include  a file specification when you issue the
  /DELETE qualifier.

/FACILITY

 /FACILITY
 /NOFACILITY

  Controls whether the facility  name  prefix  is  displayed  for  all
  messages that are returned for your process.

/IDENTIFICATION

 /IDENTIFICATION
 /NOIDENTIFICATION

  Controls whether the identification  prefix  (an  abbreviation  that
  identifies  the  message)  is  included  in  all  messages  that are
  returned for your process.

/SEVERITY

 /SEVERITY
 /NOSEVERITY

  Controls whether the severity level is displayed  for  all  messages
  that are returned for your process.

/TEXT

 /TEXT
 /NOTEXT

  Controls whether the message text is displayed for all messages that
  are returned for your process.

3 Examples

  1.   $ TYPE XXX
       TYPE-W-OPENIN, error opening DB1:[MALCOLM]XXX.LIS; as input
       -RMS-E-FNF, file not found
          .
          .
          .
       $  SET MESSAGE/NOIDENTIFICATION
          .
          .
          .
       $ TYPE XXX
       TYPE-W, error opening DB1:[MALCOLM]XXX.LIS; as input
       -RMS-E, file not found



  When the first TYPE command is issued, the  error  messages  include
  all  fields.   Later,  the  SET MESSAGE command establishes that the
  IDENT portion (the abbreviation for the message text) is omitted  on
  future messages.  Note the absence of the IDENT component in the two
  subsequent messages that result from attempting to type a file  that
  does not exist.

  2.   $ SET MESSAGE NEWMSG

  The  SET  MESSAGE  command  specifies  that  the  message  text   in
  NEWMSG.EXE supplements the existing system messages.
2 ON
  Controls whether the command  interpreter  performs  error  checking
  following the execution of each command in a command procedure.

  Format:

    SET [NO]ON

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET NOON
       $ DELETE  *.SAV;*
       $ SET ON
       $ COPY  *.OBJ  *.SAV

  This command procedure routinely copies all object modules into  new
  files  with the file type SAV.  The DELETE command first deletes all
  existing files with the SAV file type, if any.  The SET NOON command
  ensures that the procedure will continue execution even if there are
  no files with the SAV file type in the current directory.  Following
  the  DELETE  command,  the  SET  ON command restores error checking.
  Then the COPY command makes copies of all existing  files  with  OBJ
  file type.
2 OUTPUT_RATE
  Sets the rate at which output is written to a batch job log file.

  Format:

    SET OUTPUT_RATE[=delta-time]
3 Parameters

 delta-time

  Specifies how often output will be written from the output buffer to
  the   batch   job   log   file.   See Section 2.5 in the VAX/VMS DCL 
  Dictionary (or access the HELP topic SPECIFY) for information on how 
  to specify a delta time.

  If you do not specify a delta time, then DCL writes the  information
  in the output buffer to the log file but does not change the default
  output rate.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET OUTPUT_RATE=:0:30
          .
          .
          .

  This command, when executed within a batch job, changes the  default
  output rate from once a minute to once every 30 seconds.
2 PASSWORD
  Allows users to change their  own  passwords.   Also  allows  system
  managers to change the system password.

  Format:

    SET PASSWORD
3 Command_Qualifiers

/GENERATE

 /GENERATE[=value]

 Requests that passwords be  generated  for  you.   If  the  /GENERATE
  qualifier is used, the system will display five random passwords and
  ask you to select one of them.  If  you  do  not  like  any  of  the
  passwords  displayed,  pressing RETURN will cause five new passwords
  to be displayed.

  The optional value determines the number of letters in the passwords
  generated.   For  any value, n, SET PASSWORD will generate passwords
  of from n to (n+2) characters in length.  Values of 1 through 10 may
  be specified.

  If no value is specified, SET PASSWORD will use a default  value  of
  6,  and will generate passwords of from 6 to 8 characters in length.
  If a value larger than 10 is specified, it will  be  ignored  and  a
  value of 10 (the largest acceptable value) will be used instead.

  Note that if your system manager has established a minimum  password
  length  for  your account, SET PASSWORD/GENERATE=n will compare that
  length with the length of the optional value, and use the larger  of
  the two values.

/SECONDARY

 /SECONDARY

 Allows you to change your secondary password, or to create one if you
  do not currently have one.  The procedure is the same as for setting
  your primary password.

  Once a secondary password has been established, you will receive two
  PASSWORD:   prompts when logging in.  The primary password should be
  typed in first, followed by the secondary password.

  You may remove your secondary password by specifying a RETURN,  when
  SET   PASSWORD/SECONDARY   prompts   you  for  a  new  password  and
  verification.  Once this is done, you will  only  receive  a  single
  PASSWORD:  prompt when logging in.

  Secondary passwords make it possible to set up an account, such that
  two  different  people, each knowing one of the two passwords, would
  be required to access that account.

  The /SECONDARY and /SYSTEM qualifiers are incompatible.

/SYSTEM

 /SYSTEM

 Indicates that you are changing the system password, rather than your
  user  password.  Both SECURITY and CMKRNL privileges are required to
  use this qualifier.

  If a terminal line has the system password  (SYSPWD)  characteristic
  set,  no  terminal  prompts  will be sent to that terminal until the
  system password is entered.

  A system password is valid only for the node it is  set  on.   In  a
  VAXcluster, each node can have a different system password.

  Note that system passwords are not permanent and must be reset  each
  time the system is shut down.

  The /SYSTEM and /SECONDARY qualifiers are incompatible.

3 Examples
D
  1.   $ SET PASSWORD
       Old password: HONCHO
       New password: BIG_ENCHILADA
       Verification: BIG_ENCHILADA



  In response to the SET PASSWORD command, the system prompts for  the
  old  password,  next for the new password.  Then the system asks for
  the new password again for verification purposes.  If  the  user  is
  authorized to change this account's password, if the old password is
  given correctly, and if the new password is given identically twice,
  the  password  is  changed.  Otherwise, an error message appears and
  the password remains unchanged.

  Note that in a real session, neither the old password  nor  the  new
  password and its verification appear on the screen or paper.
2 PRINTER
  Establishes the characteristics of a  specific  line  printer.   The
  defaults listed below are the defaults for an initially bootstrapped
  system.

  Format:

    SET PRINTER printer-name[:]
3 Parameters

 printer-name[:]

  Specifies  the  name  of  a  line  printer  that   will   have   its
  characteristics  set  or  modified.   If the printer has been set to
  /SPOOLED, the logical I/O privilege (LOG_IO) is required  to  modify
  its characteristics.
3 Command_Qualifiers

/CR

 /CR
 /NOCR

  Controls whether  the  printer  driver  outputs  a  carriage  return
  character.   Use  this qualifier for printers on which line feeds do
  not imply carriage returns.

  Specify /NOCR for printers where the line feed, form feed,  vertical
  feed,  and carriage return characters empty the printer buffer.  The
  /NOCR qualifier causes carriage return characters to  be  held  back
  and output only if the next character is not a form feed or vertical
  tab.  Carriage return characters are always output on  devices  that
  have the carriage return function characteristic set.

  The default is /NOCR.

/FALLBACK

 /FALLBACK
 /NOFALLBACK

  Determines  whether  or  not  the  printer  attempts  to   translate
  characters  belonging  to  the DEC Multi-national character set into
  7-bit  equivalent  representations.   If  a  character   cannot   be
  translated, an underscore character will be substituted.

  If the /PASSALL qualifier is in effect, it will have precedence over
  the /FALLBACK qualifier. The default is /NOFALLBACK.

/FF

 /FF
 /NOFF

  Indicates whether the printer performs a mechanical form feed.   Use
  the  /NOFF qualifier when the printer does not automatically perform
  mechanical form feeds.  This qualifier allows the driver to  convert
  form feeds into multiple line feeds and to output them.

  The default qualifier is /FF.

/LA11

 /LA11

 Allows the operator to set the  appropriate  printer  type  when  the
  printer   is   an   LA11  line  printer.   This  qualifier  provides
  information for the SHOW PRINTER command which,  in  turn,  provides
  the  user  with  information about specific printers.  If no printer
  type is specified, LP11 is assumed.

/LA180

 /LA180

 Allows the operator to set the  appropriate  printer  type  when  the
  printer   is   an  LA180  line  printer.   This  qualifier  provides
  information for the SHOW PRINTER command which , in  turn,  provides
  the  user  with  information about specific printers.  If no printer
  type is specified, LP11 is assumed.

/LOWERCASE

 /LOWERCASE
 /NOLOWERCASE

  Indicates whether the  printer  prints  both  upper-  and  lowercase
  letters   or  only  uppercase.   When  the  operator  specifies  the
  /NOLOWERCASE qualifier, all letters are translated to uppercase.

  The /[NO]LOWERCASE and /[NO]UPPERCASE qualifiers are  complementary.
  That  is, /LOWERCASE is equivalent to /NOUPPERCASE, and /NOLOWERCASE
  is equivalent to /UPPERCASE.

  The default is /NOLOWERCASE.

/LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

  Determines whether information confirming  the  printer  setting  is
  displayed  at  the  terminal  from which the SET PRINTER command was
  issued.  By default, no log information is displayed.

/LP11

 /LP11

 Allows the operator to set the  appropriate  printer  type  when  the
  printer   is   an   LP11  line  printer.   This  qualifier  provides
  information for the SHOW PRINTER command which,  in  turn,  provides
  the  user  with  information  about  specific printers.  LP11 is the
  default printer type.

/PAGE

 /PAGE=n

 Establishes the number of lines per page on the  currently  installed
  form; the number of lines can range from 1 through 255.  The printer
  driver uses this value to determine the number of  line  feeds  that
  must  be  issued  to  simulate  a  form  feed.   (See  the /FF\/NOFF
  qualifier description for SET PRINTER.)

  The default value is 64 lines per page.

/PASSALL

 /PASSALL
 /NOPASSALL

  Controls whether the system interprets special characters or  passes
  them as eight-bit binary data.

  If you specify /PASSALL, the printer does not expand tab  characters
  to  spaces,  fill  carriage  return  or  line  feed  characters,  or
  recognize control characters.

  By default, /NOPASSALL is assumed.

/PRINTALL

 /PRINTALL
 /NOPRINTALL

  Controls whether the line printer driver outputs printable  eight-bit
  Multi-national characters. The default is /NOPRINTALL.

/TAB

 /TAB
 /NOTAB

  Controls whether the line printer driver expands TAB  characters,  or
  whether they are passed on to the hardware controller. The default is
  /NOTAB.

/TRUNCATE

 /TRUNCATE
 /NOTRUNCATE

  Controls whether the printer  truncates  data  exceeding  the  value
  specified by the /WIDTH qualifier.  The default is /TRUNCATE.

  Note that the /TRUNCATE and /WRAP qualifiers are incompatible.

/UNKNOWN

 /UNKNOWN

 Allows the operator to set the  appropriate  printer  type  when  the
  printer is an unknown type.  This qualifier provides information for
  the SHOW PRINTER command which, in  turn,  provides  the  user  with
  information  about  specific printers.  If no printer type qualifier
  is specified, LP11 is assumed.

/UPPERCASE

 /UPPERCASE
 /NOUPPERCASE

  Indicates whether the printer prints both  uppercase  and  lowercase
  letters  or  only  uppercase ones.  When you specify /UPPERCASE, all
  letters are translated to uppercase.

  The /[NO]UPPERCASE and /[NO]LOWERCASE qualifiers are  complementary.
  That  is, /UPPERCASE is equivalent to /NOLOWERCASE, and /NOUPPERCASE
  is equivalent to /LOWERCASE.

  The default is /UPPERCASE.

/WIDTH

 /WIDTH=n

 Establishes the number of characters per  output  line  on  currently
  installed  forms.   The width, n, can range from 0 through 65535 for
  LP11 controllers, and from 0 through 255 for DMF32 controllers.

  The default value is 132 characters per line.

/WRAP

 /WRAP
 /NOWRAP

  Controls whether the printer generates a carriage  return/line  feed
  when it reaches the end of a line.

  If the /NOWRAP  qualifier  is  specified,  the  printer  will  write
  characters  out  in  the  last  position  on  the line.  This is the
  default setting.

  If the /WRAP  qualifier  is  specified,  the  terminal  generates  a
  carriage return/line feed whenever the end of a line is reached.

  Note that the /TRUNCATE and /WRAP qualifiers are incompatible.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET PRINTER/PAGE=60/WIDTH=80  LPA0:

  The SET PRINTER command establishes the size of an output page as 60
  lines and the width of a line as 80 characters for printer LPA0.

  2.   $ SET PRINTER/LA11  LPB0:

  The SET PRINTER command establishes the line printer LPB0 as an LA11
  printer.

  3.   $ SET PRINTER/LOWERCASE LPA0:

  The SET PRINTER command requests that lowercase printing be  enabled
  on line printer LPA0.
2 PROCESS
  Changes the execution characteristics associated with the  specified
  process  for  the current terminal session or job.  If no process is
  specified, changes are made to the current process.

  Format:

    SET PROCESS [process-name]
3 Parameters

 process-name

  Specifies the name of the process for which the characteristics  are
  to  be  changed.   The  process  name  can  contain  from  1  to  15
  alphanumeric characters.  Process names are linked to group numbers.
  If  you  have GROUP privilege, you can specify any process name that
  has the same group UIC as the current process.

  If you specify  the  /IDENTIFICATION  qualifier,  the  process  name
  parameter  is  ignored.  If you include neither the process name nor
  the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, the current process is assumed.   You
  can use the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier to reference a process outside
  your group, providing you have the privilege to do so.

  The  process  name  parameter  is  limited  to  use  only  with  the
  /PRIORITY, /RESUME, and /SUSPEND qualifiers.
3 Command_Qualifiers

/DUMP

 /DUMP
 /NODUMP

  If an image terminates due to  an  unhandled  condition,  the  /DUMP
  qualifier  causes the contents of the address space to be written to
  a file in your current default directory.  The file name will be the
  same as the image which terminated.  The file type will be DMP.

  You can then use the ANALYZE/PROCESS_DUMP  utility  to  analyze  the
  dump.  By default, no dump of the address space is made.

/IDENTIFICATION

 /IDENTIFICATION=pid

 Specifies the process identification value (PID) of the  process  for
  which characteristics are to be changed.  The PID is assigned by the
  system when the process is created.  When you specify a PID, you can
  omit the leading zeros.

  If you use the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier, the process name parameter
  is  ignored.   GROUP or WORLD privilege is required to control other
  processes on the system.

  The /IDENTIFICATION qualifier can be used only with  the  /PRIORITY,
  /RESUME, and /SUSPEND qualifiers.

/NAME

 /NAME=string

 Changes the name of the current process to the specified  name.   The
  string parameter can have from 1 to 15 alphanumeric characters.

/PRIORITY

 /PRIORITY=n

 Changes the priority for the specified process.  The  user  privilege
  ALTPRI (alter priority) is required to increase the priority for any
  process to a value higher than the  base  priority  of  the  current
  process.   If  you  do  not have the ALTPRI privilege, the value you
  specify is compared to your current base  priority,  and  the  lower
  value is always used.

  GROUP or WORLD privilege is required to change the priority of other
  processes on the system.

/PRIVILEGES

 /PRIVILEGES=(privilege[,...])

 Enables or disables the  user privileges for the current process.  If
  you  specify  only one privilege, you can omit the parentheses.  See
  Table 1-4 in the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary in Part I  for a list of the 
  privilege keywords.  The table also contains  a  description of each 
  privilege.

  You must have SETPRV (set privilege) to enable a privilege that  you
  are  not  authorized  to  possess.   Otherwise, the privilege is not
  enabled,  and  a  warning  message  is   issued.    Use   the   SHOW
  PROCESS/PRIVILEGES   command   to   determine  what  privileges  are
  currently enabled.

/RESOURCE_WAIT

 /RESOURCE_WAIT
 /NORESOURCE_WAIT

  Enables or disables resource wait mode for the current process.

  If you specify /NORESOURCE_WAIT, the process will receive  an  error
  status  code when system dynamic memory is not available or when the
  process exceeds one of the following resource quotas:

       Direct I/O limit
       Buffered I/O limit
       Buffered I/O byte count (buffer space) quota

/RESUME

 /RESUME

 Specifies that a process suspended by a previous SET PROCESS  command
  is to be resumed.

/SUSPEND

 /SUSPEND
 /NOSUSPEND

  Controls whether to suspend or resume the process.

  If you specify /SUSPEND, the process is placed in a suspended state.
  You  must  have either GROUP or WORLD privilege in order to use this
  qualifier.

  You can specify /NOSUSPEND to have a  previously  suspended  process
  resume operation.

/SWAPPING

 /SWAPPING
 /NOSWAPPING

  Enables or disables process swap mode for the current  process.   By
  default,  a  process  that is not currently executing can be removed
  from physical memory so that other processes can execute.

  If you specify /NOSWAPPING, the process is not swapped  out  of  the
  balance  set  when  it  is  in a wait state.  You must have the user
  privilege PSWAPM (process swap privilege) to  disable  swapping  for
  your process.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET PROCESS/NORESOURCE_WAIT

  The SET PROCESS command disables resource wait mode for the  current
  process.

  2.   $ RUN/PROCESS_NAME=TESTER  CALC
       %RUN-S-PROC_ID, identification of created process is 0005002F
       $ SET PROCESS/PRIORITY=10  TESTER

  The RUN command creates a subprocess and gives it the  name  TESTER.
  Subsequently,   the   SET   PROCESS/PRIORITY   command  assigns  the
  subprocess a priority of 10.
2 PROTECTION
  Establishes the protection to be applied to a particular file  or  a
  group  of files.  The protection of a file limits the type of access
  available to system users.

  o  Establish the default protection for all the  files  subsequently
     created during the terminal session or batch job (see /DEFAULT).

  o  Establish  the  protection  to   be   applied   to   a   specific
     non-file-structured device (see /DEVICE).

  Format:

    SET PROTECTION[=(code)] file-spec[,...]
3 Parameters

 code

  Defines the protection to be applied to the specified  file(s).   If
  no code is included, the access of the specified files is set to the
  current default protection.

  The format for specifying the code is described in  Section  3.7  in
  the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary.

 file-spec[,...]

  Specifies one or more files  for  which  the  protection  is  to  be
  changed.

  A file name and file type  are  required;  if  you  omit  a  version
  number,  the  protection  is  changed  for only the highest existing
  version of the file.

  You can specify wildcard characters in  the  directory,  file  name,
  file type, and version fields.
3 Command_Qualifiers

/CONFIRM

 /CONFIRM
 /NOCONFIRM

  Controls whether  the  SET  PROTECTION  command  displays  the  file
  specification  of  each  file before applying the new protection and
  requests you to confirm if the file's protection should be  changed.
  If  you  specify  /CONFIRM,  you must respond to the prompt with a Y
  (YES) or a T (TRUE), and then press RETURN before the SET PROTECTION
  command  will  change  the  file  protection.  If you enter anything
  else, such as N or NO, the requested file protection is not applied.

  By default, the SET PROTECTION command does not request confirmation
  before changing the protection of a file.

/LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

  Controls whether  the  SET  PROTECTION  command  displays  the  file
  specification of each file after it has reset the protection.

  By default, the SET PROTECTION command does not display the names of
  files after resetting their protections.
3 Positional_Qualifier

/PROTECTION

 /PROTECTION=(code)

 Defines the protection code to be  applied  to  the  associated  file
  specification.   Use  this  qualifier to assign different protection
  codes to several files with a single SET PROTECTION command.

  If you specify the command's code parameter in addition to using the
  /PROTECTION  qualifier  with  a  file  specification, the attributes
  specified with the command's code parameter are applied first.   Any
  attributes  specified  with  the  /PROTECTION qualifier override the
  command's code parameter attributes.

  Specify the protection code using the format  described  in  Section
  3.7 in the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET PROTECTION -
       $_PAYROLL.LIS/PROTECTION=(SYSTEM:R,OWNER:RWED,GROUP:RW),-
       $_PAYROLL.OUT/PROTECTION=(SYSTEM:RWED,GROUP:RWED,W)

  The SET PROTECTION command changes the protection codes  applied  to
  two  files.   To the file PAYROLL.LIS, it gives the system read-only
  access, the owner read, write, execute, and delete access, and users
  in the owner's group read/write access.  To the file PAYROLL.OUT, it
  gives the system and group all types of access; the  current  access
  for  the owner does not change, but the world is denied all types of
  access.

  2.   $ SET PROTECTION A.DAT, B.DAT/PROTECTION=OWNER:RWED, C.DAT

  The SET PROTECTION command specifies  that  the  file  A.DAT  should
  receive  the  default  protection  established  for your files.  The
  existing protection for the file B.DAT is overridden, only  for  the
  owner  category, to provide read, write, execute, and delete access.
  Note that no protection is specified for the file  C.DAT  at  either
  the  command  or  file  level.  Thus, like A.DAT, C.DAT receives the
  default protection.

  Since  no  version  numbers  are  specified  in  this  example,  the
  protection  settings  affect  only the highest versions of the three
  files.

  3.   $ SET PROTECTION=OWNER:D -
       $_[MALCOLM.SUB1]SUB2.DIR/PROTECTION=GROUP:D

  The SET PROTECTION command changes the protection for the owner  and
  group  categories  of the subdirectory [MALCOLM.SUB1.SUB2] to permit
  deletion.   However,  the  protection  for  the  world  and   system
  categories is not changed.

  4.   $ DIR/PROTECTION INCOME.DAT

       Directory DBA0:[SMITH]

       INCOME.DAT;2         (RWED,RWED,RWED,RWED)
       INCOME.DAT;1         (RWED,RWED,RWED,RWED)

       Total of 2 files.
       $ SET PROTECTION=(OWNER:RWE) INCOME.DAT;1
       $ PURGE

  The file INCOME.DAT;1 has been protected  against  deletion  by  the
  owner.   However,  since the owner is also a member of the group and
  world categories, the file is still  vulnerable  to  deletion.   The
  subsequent PURGE command will delete INCOME.DAT;1.

  In order to protect the file against deletion by  you  (the  owner),
  you  also  need  to  protect  the file against deletion by all outer
  access categories.  The following command shows the proper way to do
  this.

  5.   $ SET PROTECTION=(OWNER:RWE,GROUP:RWE,WORLD:RWE) INCOME.DAT;1

3 /DEFAULT
  Establishes  the  default  protection  for  all  files  subsequently
  created  during  the  terminal session or batch job.  The protection
  for a file limits the type of access available to system users.  The
  /DEFAULT qualifier is required.

  Format:

    SET PROTECTION[=(code)]/DEFAULT
4 Parameters

 code

  Defines the protection to  be  applied  to  all  files  subsequently
  created  in cases where a different protection is not specified with
  the SET PROTECTION or CREATE commands.  The  format  for  specifying
  the  protection  code  is  described  in  Section 3.7 in the VAX/VMS
  DCL Dictionary.

  If you fail to  specify  a  protection  code,  the  current  default
  protection remains unchanged.

4 Examples

  1.   $ SET PROTECTION=(GROUP:RWED,WORLD:R)/DEFAULT

  The SET  PROTECTION/DEFAULT  command  sets  the  default  protection
  applied  to  all  files subsequently created to allow other users in
  the same group unlimited access, and all  users  read  access.   The
  default protections for system and owner are not changed.
3 /DEVICE
  Establishes  the  protection   to   be   applied   to   a   specific
  non-file-structured  device.  The protection for a device limits the
  type of  access  available  to  users.   The  /DEVICE  qualifier  is
  required.

  Format:

    SET PROTECTION[=code]/DEVICE device-name[:]
4 Parameters

 code

  Establishes the protection code for a device.  The  protection  code
  defines  the  user  and  type  of access allowed the user.  The code
  should be specified according to the syntax rules explained  in  the
  Description section below.

  If the operator does not specify a protection  code,  no  protection
  checks are made and all users are allowed access to the device.

 device-name[:]

  Specifies the name of the device whose protection is to  be  set  or
  modified.  The device must be a non-file-structured device.
4 Command_Qualifier

/OWNER_UIC

 /OWNER_UIC=uic

 Requests  that  the  specified  user  identification  code  (UIC)  be
  assigned  ownership  of the device for the purpose of access checks.
  The default owner  is  the  UIC  of  the  process  issuing  the  SET
  PROTECTION command.

  Specify the UIC using standard UIC format as  described  in  Section
  3.7.1  in  the  VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary  (or  access  the  HELP topic 
  SPECIFY).

4 Examples

  1.   $ SET PROTECTION=(S:RWLP,O:RWLP,G,W)/DEVICE  LAA0:

  This command requests that the protection for device LAA0 be set  to
  allow all types of access to system processes and processes with the
  UIC of the current process and to deny access to anyone else.

  2.   $ SET PROTECTION=(S:R,O,G,W)/DEVICE/OWNER_UIC=[1,4] TTA1:

  This command requests that the protection for the terminal  TTA1  is
  to  be set to allow only system processes to allocate the device and
  denies accessibility to the device to anyone  else.   This  type  of
  protection  is  recommended  for  interactive terminals, if a secure
  system is desired.  Note that the above  protection  code  restricts
  which  users  can  allocate  the device, but does not restrict users
  from logging in to the device.
2 PROMPT
  Enables you to have DCL use a different prompt string.

  Format:

    SET PROMPT[=string]
3 Parameters

 string

  Specifies the string to replace the default DCL prompt  string----"$
  ".   The  string  can consist of more than one character.  All valid
  ASCII characters can be used in the string.

  In order to include spaces or lowercase letters in your string,  you
  must  enclose the string in quotation marks.  Otherwise, letters are
  automatically converted  to  uppercase,  and  leading  and  trailing
  spaces are removed.

  If no string is specified with  the  SET  PROMPT  command,  the  DCL
  default prompt string "$ " is restored.
3 Command_Qualifier

/CARRIAGE_CONTROL

 /CARRIAGE_CONTROL
 /NOCARRIAGE_CONTROL

  Determines whether carriage return  and  line  feed  characters  are
  inserted    before    the    prompt    string.    The   default   is
  /CARRIAGE_CONTROL.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET PROMPT ="DCL ---> "
       DCL ---> SHOW TIME
        15-APR-1984 14:08:58 

  The dollar sign prompt is replaced with  the  string  "DCL  --->  ".
  When  you  see  the  prompt  on  your  screen, you can enter any DCL
  command.  This example uses the SHOW TIME command.

2 QUEUE
  Changes the current status or attributes of the specified queue.

  o  Change the current status or attributes of  a  job  that  is  not
     currently executing in a queue (see /ENTRY).

  Format:

    SET QUEUE queue-name[:]
3 Parameters

 queue-name[:]

  Specifies the name of an execution queue or a generic queue.
3 Command_Qualifiers

/BASE_PRIORITY

 /BASE_PRIORITY=n

 Specifies the base process priority at which jobs are initiated  from
  a batch queue.  (You must stop and restart symbiont queues to change
  the symbiont  priority  for  printer  or  terminal  queues.)  The  n
  specifier can be any decimal value from 0 through 15.

/BLOCK_LIMIT

 /BLOCK_LIMIT=([lowlim,]uplim)
 /NOBLOCK_LIMIT

  Limits the size of print jobs that can be executed on a  printer  or
  terminal  queue.   This  qualifier  allows  you  to  reserve certain
  printers for certain size jobs.  You must specify at  least  one  of
  the parameters.

  The lowlim parameter is a decimal number referring  to  the  minimum
  number of blocks that will be accepted by the queue for a print job.
  If a  print job  is submitted that contains  fewer blocks  than  the  
  lowlim value,  the  job remains  pending until the job limit for the
  queue is changed, enabling it to execute.

  The uplim parameter is a decimal number  referring  to  the  maximum
  number of blocks that will be accepted by the queue for a print job.
  If a print job is submitted that exceeds this value, the job remains
  until  the  job  limit  for  the  queue  is  changed, enabling it to
  execute.

  If you specify only an upper  limit  for  jobs,  you  can  omit  the
  parentheses.   For  example,  /BLOCK_LIMIT=1000 means that only jobs
  with 1000 blocks or less will execute in the  queue.   In  order  to
  specify  only  a  lower  job  limit, you must use two sets of double
  quotation marks to  indicate  the  upper  specifier.   For  example,
  /BLOCK_LIMIT=(500,""  means  any  job  with  500 or more blocks will
  execute in the queue.  You can specify both a lower and upper limit.
  For  example, /BLOCK_LIMIT=(200,2000) means that jobs with less than
  200 blocks or more than 2000 blocks will not run in the queue.

  The  /NOBLOCK_LIMIT  qualifier  cancels  the  /BLOCK_LIMIT   setting
  previously established for that queue.

/CHARACTERISTICS

 /CHARACTERISTICS=(characteristic[,...])
 /NOCHARACTERISTICS

  Specifies one or more characteristics for  processing  jobs  on  the
  queue.   If  only  one characteristic is specified, you can omit the
  parentheses.

  Each  time  you  specify  /CHARACTERISTICS,   all   previously   set
  characteristics  are  erased.   Only  the  ones  specified  with the
  qualifier are now established for the queue.

  Queue characteristics are installation-specific.  The characteristic
  parameter   can   be  either  a  value  from  0  through  127  or  a
  characteristic   name    that    has    been    defined    by    the
  DEFINE/CHARACTERISTIC command.

  When users include the /CHARACTERISTICS qualifier with  a  PRINT  or
  SUBMIT  command,  all  the characteristics they specify must also be
  specified for the queue that will be executing the job.  If not, the
  job will remain pending in the queue until the queue characteristics
  are changed or they delete the entry with the DELETE/ENTRY  command.
  Users  need not specify every characteristic of a queue with a PRINT
  or SUBMIT command as long as the ones they specify are a  subset  of
  the characteristics set for that queue.  The job will also run if no
  characteristics are specified.

  The  /NOCHARACTERISTICS  qualifier   cancels   any   /CHARACTERISTIC
  settings previously established for that queue.

/CPUDEFAULT

 /CPUDEFAULT=time

 Defines the default CPU time limit for batch jobs.

  Specify the CPU default time as a  delta  time  value,  the  numeric
  value  0,  or  the  keyword  NONE  or INFINITE.  The value 0 and the
  keyword  INFINITE  allow  a  job  unlimited  CPU  time,  subject  to
  restrictions  imposed  by  the  /CPUMAXIMUM  qualifier  or  the user
  authorization file (UAF).  Specify NONE  when  a  default  CPU  time
  limit is not needed.

  The time cannot exceed the CPU time limit  set  by  the  /CPUMAXIMUM
  qualifier.  See Section 2.5 in the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary (or access 
  the HELP topic SPECIFY)  for information  on specifying delta times.

/CPUMAXIMUM

 /CPUMAXIMUM=time

 Defines the  maximum  CPU  time  limit  for  batch  jobs.   Use  this
  qualifier  to  override  the  CPU  time  limit specified in the user
  authorization file (UAF).

  Specify CPU maximum time as a delta time value, the numeric value 0,
  or  the word NONE or INFINITE.  Specify NONE when a maximum CPU time
  limit   is   not  desired.   See  Section  2.5  in  the  VAX/VMS DCL
  Dictionary  (or access the HELP topic SPECIFY)  for  information  on 
  specifying delta times.

  A CPU time limit for processes is specified by each user  record  in
  the  system  (UAF).   You can also specify the following:  a default
  CPU time limit for all jobs in a given queue and a maximum CPU  time
  limit  for  all  jobs  in  a  given  queue.  Refer to Table 1 in the
  VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary for more information  on  specifying CPU time 
  limits.

/DEFAULT

 /DEFAULT=(option[,...])
 /NODEFAULT

  Establishes defaults for  certain  options  of  the  PRINT  command.
  Defaults  are specified by the list of options.  If you specify only
  one option, you can omit the parentheses.  Once an option is set for
  the  queue  by  the /DEFAULT qualifier, users do not have to specify
  that option in their PRINT commands.

  The options are:

       [NO]BURST[=keyword]     Specifies whether file burst pages will
                               be  printed. If the keyword is ALL (the
                               default), burst pages are placed before
                               each  file  in  the  print  job. If the
                               keyword is ONE, a burst page is  placed
                               before the first copy of the first file
                               in the job.

       [NO]FEED                Specifies  whether   a   form-feed   is
                               automatically  inserted at the end of a
                               page.

       [NO]FLAG[=keyword]      Specifies whether file flag pages  will
                               be  printed. If the keyword is ALL (the
                               default), flag pages are placed  before
                               each  file  in  the  print  job. If the
                               keyword is ONE, a flag page  is  placed
                               before the first copy of the first file
                               in the job.

       [NO]TRAILER[=keyword]   Specifies whether  file  trailer  pages
                               will  be printed. If the keyword is ALL
                               (the default), trailer pages are placed
                               at  the  end  of each file in the print
                               job. If the keyword is ONE,  a  trailer
                               page  is  placed after the last copy of
                               the last file in the job.

/DISABLE_SWAPPING

 /DISABLE_SWAPPING
 /NODISABLE_SWAPPING

  Controls whether batch jobs executed from a queue can be swapped  in
  and out of memory.

/ENABLE_GENERIC

 /ENABLE_GENERIC
 /NOENABLE_GENERIC

  Specifies whether files queued to a generic queue that does not have
  specific   targets  can  be  placed  in  this  execution  queue  for
  processing.

/FORM

 /FORM=type

 Specifies the form type for a printer  or  terminal  queue.   Once  a
  queue  has been assigned a form type, all jobs in that queue that do
  not conform to that form type remain in the  queue  until  the  form
  type  of  the  queue  changes  to  correspond  to  the form that was
  specified in the PRINT command.

  Specify the form type using a numeric value or a form name that  has
  been   defined   by   the   DEFINE/FORM  command.   Form  types  are
  installation-specific.

/JOB_LIMIT

 /JOB_LIMIT=n

 Indicates the number of batch jobs that can be executed  concurrently
  from the queue.

/OWNER_UIC

 /OWNER_UIC=uic

 Enables you to change the user identification code UIC of the  queue.
  Specify  the  UIC  using standard UIC format as described in Section
  3.7.1  in  the  VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary (or  access  the  HELP  topic 
  SPECIFY).

  Use of this qualifier requires OPER (operator) privilege.

/PROTECTION

 /PROTECTION=(codes)

 Specifies the  protection  of  the  queue.   By  default,  the  queue
  protection is (SYSTEM:E, OWNER:D, GROUP:R, WORLD:W).  If you include
  only one protection code, you can omit the parentheses.

  Use of this qualifier requires OPER (operator) privilege.

/RETAIN

 /RETAIN[=option]
 /NORETAIN

  Specifies that jobs be retained in the queue in a  completed  status
  after they have executed.

  The option parameter can be the keyword ALL or  ERROR.   If  ALL  is
  specified,  all  jobs are retained in the queue after execution.  If
  ERROR is specified, only jobs that have completed unsuccessfully are
  retained  in  the  queue.   If you omit the option parameter, ALL is
  assumed.

  The /NORETAIN qualifier enables  you  to  reset  the  queue  to  the
  default.

/SCHEDULE

 /SCHEDULE=[NO]SIZE

 Specifies whether pending jobs in a printer  or  terminal  queue  are
  scheduled  for  printing  based  on  the  size of the job.  When the
  default, /SCHEDULE=SIZE, is  in  effect,  shorter  jobs  will  print
  before  longer ones.  With /SCHEDULE=NOSIZE, jobs are printed in the
  order they were submitted, regardless of size.

  If you issue this command while there are pending jobs in any queue,
  its effect on future jobs is unpredictable.

/SEPARATE

 /SEPARATE=(option[,...])
 /NOSEPARATE

  Specifies the job separation defaults  for  a  printer  or  terminal
  queue.  The job separation options are:

       [NO]BURST                    Specifies  whether  a  burst  page
                                    will  be  printed at the beginning
                                    of  every  job.  Specifying  BURST
                                    also  results in a flag page being
                                    printed.

       [NO]FLAG                     Specifies whether a flag page will
                                    be  printed  at  the  beginning of
                                    every job.

       [NO]TRAILER                  Specifies whether a  trailer  page
                                    will  be  printed  at  the  end of
                                    every job.

       [NO]RESET=(module[,...])     Specifies a job reset sequence for
                                    the queue. The specified module(s)
                                    from the  device  control  library
                                    are  used to reset the device each
                                    time a job reset occurs.

/WSDEFAULT

 /WSDEFAULT=n

 Defines a working set default for a batch job.  The value set by this
  qualifier overrides the value defined in the user authorization file
  (UAF) of any user submitting a job to the queue.

  Specify a positive integer in the range 1 through 65535, 0,  or  the
  word  NONE as the value for n.  If 0 or NONE is specified for n, the
  working set default value defaults to the value specified either  in
  the  UAF  or  by  the  SUBMIT  command  (if  specified).   For  more
  information refer to Table 2 in the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary.

/WSEXTENT

 /WSEXTENT=n

 Defines a working set extent for the batch job.   The  value  set  by
  this qualifier overrides the value defined in the user authorization
  file (UAF) of any user submitting a job to the queue.

  Specify a positive integer in the range 1 through 65535, 0,  or  the
  word  NONE as the value for n.  If 0 or NONE is specified for n, the
  working set extent value defaults to the value specified  either  in
  the  UAF  or  by  the  SUBMIT  command  (if  specified).   For  more
  information refer to Table 2 in the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary.

/WSQUOTA

 /WSQUOTA=n

 Defines the working set page size (working set  quota)  for  a  batch
  job.  The value set by this qualifier overrides the value defined in
  the user authorization file (UAF) of any user submitting  a  job  to
  the queue.

  Specify a positive integer in the range 1 through 65535, 0,  or  the
  word  NONE as the value for n.  If 0 or NONE is specified for n, the
  working set quota value defaults to the value  specified  either  in
  the  UAF  or  by  the  SUBMIT  command  (if  specified).   For  more
  information refer to Table 2 in the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary.

  A working set default size and a working set  quota  (maximum  size)
  are  included  in  each user record in the system user authorization
  file (UAF), and can be specified for individual jobs and/or for  all
  jobs  in  a given queue.  The decision table (Table 2 in the VAX/VMS
  DCL Dictionary)  shows  the action taken for different  combinations  
  of  specifications that involve working set  size  and  working  set 
  quota values.
3 /ENTRY
  Changes the current status or  attributes  of  a  job  that  is  not
  currently executing in a queue.  The /ENTRY qualifier is required.

  Format:

    SET QUEUE/ENTRY=entry-number [queue-name[:]]
4 Parameters

 entry-number

  Specifies the entry number of the job you want to change.

 queue-name[:]

  Specifies the name of the  queue  in  which  the  specified  job  is
  entered.

  If you do not specify a queue name, the  system  assumes  a  printer
  queue with the default name SYS$PRINT.
4 Command_Qualifiers

/AFTER

 /AFTER=time

 Requests that the specified job be held until after a specific  time.
  If  the  specified  time  has  already passed, the job is queued for
  immediate processing.

  You can specify either an absolute time or a combination of absolute
  and  delta  times.   See  Section 2.5 in  the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary 
  (or access the HELP topic  SPECIFY)  for  complete   information  on 
  specifying time values.

/BURST

 /BURST
 /NOBURST

  Controls whether a burst page is included  at  the  beginning  of  a
  print  job.  A burst page precedes a flag page and contains the same
  information.  However, it is printed over  the  perforation  between
  the  burst  page and the flag page.  The printing on the perforation
  makes it easy to separate individual print jobs.

  When you specify /BURST, you need not specify  /FLAG;  a  flag  page
  will automatically follow the burst page.

  When you use the /BURST qualifier with the SET QUEUE/ENTRY  command,
  burst pages are placed at the beginning of each file in a multi-file
  job.

  Use the /[NO]BURST qualifier to  override  the  installation-defined
  defaults that have been set for the printer queue you are using.

/CHARACTERISTICS

 /CHARACTERISTICS=(characteristic[,...])

 Enables you to change the characteristics desired for  the  job.   If
  you  specify  only one characteristic, you can omit the parentheses.
  Codes for characteristics can be either names or values  from  0  to
  127     and     are     installation-defined.     Use    the    SHOW
  QUEUE/CHARACTERISTICS command to see which characteristics have been
  defined  for  your  system.   Use the SHOW QUEUE/FULL command to see
  which characteristics are available on a particular queue.

  When  you  include  the  /CHARACTERISTICS  qualifier  with  the  SET
  QUEUE/ENTRY  command,  all the characteristics you specify must also
  be specified for the queue that will be executing the job.  If  not,
  the   job   will  remain  pending  in  the  queue  until  the  queue
  characteristics are  changed  or  you  delete  the  entry  with  the
  DELETE/ENTRY  command.  You need not specify every characteristic of
  a queue with the SET QUEUE/ENTRY command as long  as  the  ones  you
  specify are a subset of the characteristics set for that queue.  The
  job will also run if no characteristics are specified.

  Specification of a characteristic for a queue does not prevent  jobs
  that do not specify that characteristic from being executed.

/CLI

 /CLI=filename

 Enables you to specify a different command language interpreter (CLI)
  to  use in processing the job.  The file name specifies that the CLI
  be  SYS$SYSTEM:filename.EXE.   If  you  do  not  specify  the   /CLI
  qualifier,  the  job  is  run  by  the  CLI  specified in the user's
  authorization record, or whatever CLI was specified when the job was
  originally submitted to the queue.

/COPIES

 /COPIES=n

 Specifies the number of copies to print.  The n parameter can be  any
  number from 1 to 255.

  When you use the /COPIES qualifier with the SET QUEUE/ENTRY command,
  the  number  of copies can apply only to the entire job.  You cannot
  use this qualifier  to  specify  different  numbers  of  copies  for
  individual files within a multi-file job.

/CPUTIME

 /CPUTIME=option

 Defines a CPU time limit for the batch job.  You can specify a  delta
  time  (see  Section  2.5  in  the  VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary (or access 
  the  HELP  topic  SPECIFY)), the value 0, or  the  keyword  NONE  or 
  INFINITE for n.

  When you need less  CPU  time  than  authorized,  use  the  /CPUTIME
  qualifier to override the base queue value established by the system
  manager or the value authorized in  your  user  authorization  file.
  Specify  0  or  INFINITE  to  request  an  infinite  amount of time.
  Specify NONE when you want the CPU time  to  default  to  your  user
  authorization  file (UAF) value or the limit specified on the queue.
  Note that you cannot request more time than permitted  by  the  base
  queue limits or your own UAF.

/FEED

 /FEED
 /NOFEED

  Controls whether form feeds are inserted into print  jobs  when  the
  printer  nears  the end of a page.  The number of lines per form can
  be reset by the /FORM qualifier.  You can  suppress  this  automatic
  form  feed  (without  affecting  any  of  the other carriage control
  functions that are in place) by using the /NOFEED qualifier.

  When you use the /FEED qualifier with the SET  QUEUE/ENTRY  command,
  the qualifier applies to all files in the print job.  You cannot use
  this qualifier to specify form feeds for individual files  within  a
  multi-file job.

/FLAG

 /FLAG
 /NOFLAG

  Controls whether a flag page is printed preceding a print job.   The
  flag  page contains the name of the user submitting the job, the job
  entry number, and other information about the job.

  When you use the /FLAG qualifier with the SET  QUEUE/ENTRY  command,
  flag  pages are placed at the beginning of each file in a multi-file
  job.

  Use the /[NO]FLAG qualifier  to  override  the  installation-defined
  defaults that have been set for the printer queue you are using.

/FORM

 /FORM=type

 Specifies the name of the form that you want for the print job.

  Specify the form type using a numeric value  or  alphanumeric  code.
  Form  types can refer to the width, length, or type of paper.  Codes
  for form types are  installation-defined.   You  can  use  the  SHOW
  QUEUE/FORM  command  to  find  out the form types available for your
  system.  The SHOW QUEUE/FULL command tells you which form is set for
  a specific queue.

  If you specify a form type different from that of  the  queue,  your
  job remains pending until the form type of the queue is set equal to
  the form type of the job or you delete the job with the DELETE/ENTRY
  command.  You can use the SET QUEUE/ENTRY to change the form type of
  your job to match that of the queue so your job can be printed.   In
  order  to have the form type for the queue changed, request that the
  system manager stop the queue, physically change the  form  type  of
  the printer, and restart the queue specifying the new form type.

/HEADER

 /HEADER
 /NOHEADER

  Controls whether a heading line is printed at the top of each output
  page in a print job.

/HOLD

 /HOLD
 /NOHOLD

  Controls whether or  not  the  job  is  to  be  made  available  for
  immediate processing.

  If you specify /HOLD, the job is not released for  processing  until
  you  specifically release it with the /NOHOLD or /RELEASE qualifier.
  You can use the SET QUEUE/ENTRY command to release a  job  that  was
  previously  submitted  with a /HOLD qualifier or you can place a job
  on hold so that it will run later.

  You can use the /NOHOLD qualifier to release  jobs  that  have  been
  held for the following reasons:

  o  A job was submitted with the /HOLD qualifier.

  o  A job was submitted with the /AFTER qualifier.

  o  A completed job is  being  held  in  a  queue  that  has  /RETAIN
     specified.

  o  A user-written symbiont has refused a job.

/JOB_COUNT

 /JOB_COUNT=n

 Requests that an entire print job be printed n times, where  n  is  a
  decimal  integer  from  1  to  255.   This  qualifier  overrides the
  /JOB_COUNT qualifier specified or defaulted with the PRINT command.

/KEEP

 /KEEP
 /NOKEEP

  Controls whether the batch job log  file  is  deleted  after  it  is
  printed.

/LOG_FILE

 /LOG_FILE=file-spec
 /NOLOG_FILE

  Controls whether a log file with the specified name is  created  for
  the batch job or whether a log file is created.

  When you use the /LOG_FILE qualifier, the system writes the log file
  to  the  file  you  specify.  If you use /NOLOG_FILE, no log file is
  created.  If neither form of the qualifier has  been  used  for  the
  job, the log file is written to a file in the default directory that
  has the same file name as the first command file and a file type  of
  LOG.

  You can use the /LOG_FILE qualifier to specify that the log file  be
  written   to   a  different  device.   Logical  names  in  the  file
  specification are translated in the  context  of  the  process  that
  executes  the  SET  QUEUE/ENTRY  command.  The process executing the
  batch job must have access to the device on which the log file  will
  reside.

  If you omit the /LOG_FILE qualifier and specify the /NAME qualifier,
  the  log file is written to a file having the same file name as that
  specified by the /NAME qualifier; the file type is  LOG.   When  you
  omit  the  /LOG_FILE  qualifier,  the job-name value used with /NAME
  must be a valid file name.

/LOWERCASE

 /LOWERCASE
 /NOLOWERCASE

  Indicates whether the file(s) must be printed on a printer that  can
  print  both  uppercase  and  lowercase  letters.   The  /NOLOWERCASE
  qualifier means that files can be  printed  on  printers  supporting
  only  uppercase  letters.   If all available printers can print both
  uppercase  and  lowercase  letters,  you  do  not  need  to  specify
  /LOWERCASE.

/NAME

 /NAME=job-name

 Defines a name string to identify the job.  The name string can  have
  from  1  to  39  characters.  The job name is used in the SHOW QUEUE
  command display.  For batch jobs, the job name is also used for  the
  batch  job  log  file.  For print jobs, the job name is also used on
  the flag page of the printed output.

  If the /NAME qualifier has not been specified for the job, the  name
  string  defaults to the file name of the first, or only, file in the
  job; the file type is LOG.

/NOCHECKPOINT

 /NOCHECKPOINT

 For a batch job, erases the value established by  the  most  recently
  executed  SET  RESTART_VALUE  command.   For a print job, clears the
  stored checkpoint so that the job will restart from the beginning.

/NODELETE

 /NODELETE

 Cancels file deletion for a job that was submitted with  the  /DELETE
  qualifier.   If  no /DELETE qualifier was specified when the job was
  originally  submitted  to  the  queue,  you  cannot  use   the   SET
  QUEUE/ENTRY to establish file deletion at a later time.

  You cannot use the /NODELETE qualifier to  specify  that  individual
  files in a multi-file job not be deleted.

/NOTE

 /NOTE=string

 Allows you to specify a message to appear on the flag  page  for  the
  print job.  The string can contain up to 255 characters.

/NOTIFY

 /NOTIFY
 /NONOTIFY

  Controls whether a message is broadcast to any terminal at which you
  are  logged  in,  notifying  you when your job has been completed or
  aborted.

/OPERATOR

 /OPERATOR=string

 Allows you to specify a message to be  sent  to  the  operator.   The
  string can contain up to 255 characters.

  When the job begins execution, the queue pauses and the  message  is
  transmitted to the operator.

/PAGES

 /PAGES=([l,]u)

 Specifies the number of pages to print for the  specified  job.   You
  can use the /PAGES qualifier to print portions of a long file.

  When you use the /PAGES qualifier with the SET QUEUE/ENTRY  command,
  the  qualifier can only apply to an entire job.  You cannot use this
  qualifier to specify different numbers of pages to  be  printed  for
  individual files within a multi-file job.

  The l (lower) specifier refers to the first page  in  the  group  of
  pages  that  you  want  printed  for  that  job.   If you omit the l
  specifier, the printing starts on the first page of the job.  The  u
  (upper)  specifier refers to the last page of the file that you want
  printed.  When you want to print to the end of the file but  do  not
  know how many pages that will be, you can use "" as the u specifier.
  You can omit the parentheses when you specify only a  value  for  u.
  For  example,  /PAGES=10  prints  the  first  10  pages  of the job;
  /PAGES=(5,10)  prints  pages  5  through  10;  /PAGES=(5,"")  starts
  printing  at  page  5  and  continues  until  the  end of the job is
  reached.

/PARAMETERS

 /PARAMETERS=(parameter[,...])

 Specifies from 1 to 8 optional parameters to be passed  to  the  job.
  Each parameter can have as many as 255 characters.

  If you specify only one parameter, you  can  omit  the  parentheses.
  The  commas  delimit  individual parameters.  To specify a parameter
  that contains any special  characters  or  delimiters,  enclose  the
  parameter in quotation marks.

  For batch jobs, the parameters define values to be  equated  to  the
  symbols  named  P1  through P8 in each command procedure in the job.
  The symbols are local to the specified command procedure(s).

/PASSALL

 /PASSALL
 /NOPASSALL

  Specifies that the output symbiont print the job in PASSALL mode.

  When you  use  the  /PASSALL  qualifier  with  the  SET  QUEUE/ENTRY
  command,  the  qualifier  applies to the entire job.  You cannot use
  this qualifier to specify PASSALL mode for individual files within a
  multi-file job.

/PRINTER

 /PRINTER[=queue-name]
 /NOPRINTER

  Controls whether the batch job log is queued for printing when  your
  job  is  completed.   The /PRINTER qualifier allows you to specify a
  particular printer queue.

  If you specify /NOPRINTER, /KEEP is assumed.

/PRIORITY

 /PRIORITY=n

 Specifies the priority of the job.  The priority value must be in the
  range  of  0  through 255, where 0 is the lowest priority and 255 is
  the highest.

  The default value for /PRIORITY is the value of the SYSGEN parameter
  DEFQUEPRI.   You  must  have either OPER (operator) or ALTPRI (alter
  priority) privilege to raise the priority value above the  value  of
  the  SYSGEN  parameter MAXQUEPRI.  No privilege is needed to set the
  priority lower than the MAXQUEPRI value.

/RELEASE

 /RELEASE

 Releases a previously held job for  processing.   You  can  use  this
  qualifier  to  release  jobs  that  have been held for the following
  reasons:

  o  A job was submitted with the /HOLD qualifier.

  o  A job was submitted with the /AFTER qualifier.

  o  A completed job is  being  held  in  a  queue  that  has  /RETAIN
     specified.

  o  A user-written symbiont has refused a job.

/REQUEUE

 /REQUEUE=queue-name[:]

 Requests that the job  be  moved  from  the  original  queue  to  the
  specified queue.

/RESTART

 /RESTART
 /NORESTART

  Specifies whether a batch or print job will restart after  a  system
  crash or a STOP/QUEUE/REQUEUE command.

/SETUP

 /SETUP=module[,...]

 Calls for the specified module(s) to be  extracted  from  the  device
  control library and copied to the printer before a job is printed.

  When you use the /SETUP qualifier with the SET QUEUE/ENTRY  command,
  the  qualifier  applies  to  the  entire  job.   You cannot use this
  qualifier to specify different setup modules  for  individual  files
  within a multi-file job.

/SPACE

 /SPACE
 /NOSPACE

  Controls whether output is to be double-spaced.

  When you use the /SPACE qualifier with the SET QUEUE/ENTRY  command,
  the  qualifier  applies  to  the  entire  job.   You cannot use this
  qualifier to specify different spacing for individual files within a
  multi-file job.

/TRAILER

 /TRAILER
 /NOTRAILER

  Controls whether a trailer page is printed at the end of a job.  The
  trailer  page  displays the job entry number, as well as information
  about the user submitting the job.

  When you  use  the  /TRAILER  qualifier  with  the  SET  QUEUE/ENTRY
  command,  trailer  pages  are  placed  at  the end of each file in a
  multi-file job.

  Use the /[NO]TRAILER qualifier to override the  installation-defined
  defaults that have been set for the printer queue you are using.

/WSDEFAULT

 /WSDEFAULT=n

 Defines a working set default for a batch job.   You  can  specify  a
  positive  integer  in the range 1 through 65535, 0, or the word NONE
  for n.

  Use this qualifier to override the base queue value  established  by
  the system manager or the value authorized in the user authorization
  file (UAF), provided you want to impose a lower value.  Specify 0 or
  NONE  if  you want the working set value defaulted to either the UAF
  value or the working set quota specified on the queue.   You  cannot
  request a value higher than the default.

/WSEXTENT

 /WSEXTENT=n

 Defines a working set extent for a batch  job.   You  can  specify  a
  positive  integer  in the range 1 through 65535, 0, or the word NONE
  for n.

  Use this qualifier to override the base queue value  established  by
  the system manager or the value authorized in the user authorization
  file (UAF), provided you want to impose a lower value.  Specify 0 or
  NONE  if you want the working set extent defaulted to either the UAF
  or the working set  extent  specified  on  the  queue.   You  cannot
  request a value higher than the default.

/WSQUOTA

 /WSQUOTA=n

 Defines the maximum working set size for a batch job.   This  is  the
  working  set quota.  You can specify a positive integer in the range
  1 through 65535, 0, or the word NONE for n.

  Use this qualifier to override the base queue value  established  by
  the system manager or the value authorized in the user authorization
  file (UAF), provided you want to impose a lower value.  Specify 0 or
  NONE  if you want the working set quota defaulted to either the user
  authorization file value or the working set quota specified  on  the
  queue.  You cannot request a value higher than the default.

4 Examples

  1.   $ PRINT/HOLD   MYFILE.DAT
         Job MYFILE (queue SYS$PRINT, entry 112) holding
          .
          .
          .
       $ SET QUEUE/ENTRY=112/RELEASE/JOB_COUNT=3

  The PRINT command requests that the file MYFILE.DAT be queued to the
  system  printer,  but  placed in a hold status.  The SET QUEUE/ENTRY
  command releases the file for printing and  changes  the  number  of
  copies of the job to three.

  2.   $ SUBMIT  WEATHER
         Job WEATHER (queue SYS$BATCH, entry 210) pending
       $ SUBMIT  CLIMATE
         Job CLIMATE (queue SYS$BATCH, entry 211) pending
       $ SET  QUEUE/ENTRY=211/HOLD/NAME=TEMP  SYS$BATCH

  The  two  SUBMIT  commands  queue  command  procedures   for   batch
  processing.   The  system  assigns  them job numbers of 210 and 211,
  respectively.  The SET QUEUE/ENTRY command places the second job  in
  a hold state and changes the job name to TEMP, assuming that job 211
  had not yet begun.
2 RESTART_VALUE
  Establishes a test value for restarting portions of batch jobs.   If
  the command is encountered by the system interactively, no action is
  taken.  Use the SET RESTART_VALUE in command procedures.

  Format:

    SET RESTART_VALUE=string
3 Parameters

 string

  Specifies the test value to be used in the batch  job.   The  string
  can contain up to 255 characters.
2 RMS_DEFAULT
  Defines default values for the multiblock  and  multibuffer  counts,
  network  transfer  sizes,  prolog level, and extend quantity used by
  VAX RMS for file  operations.   Defaults  are  set  for  sequential,
  indexed  sequential  (ISAM),  or  relative  file  organizations on a
  process-only basis, unless a system-wide basis is requested.

  Format:

    SET RMS_DEFAULT
3 Command_Qualifiers

/BLOCK_COUNT

 /BLOCK_COUNT=count

 Specifies a default multiblock count for sequential  file  operations
  to and from a disk.  The specified count, representing the number of
  blocks to be allocated for each I/O buffer, can range from 0 through
  127.

  If you specify 0, RMS uses the process default value.  If this value
  is 0, RMS then uses the system default value.  If the system default
  value is also 0, then RMS uses a value of 1.

  The /BLOCK_COUNT qualifier applies only to  record  I/O  operations,
  not block I/O operations.

  For more information on multiblock count, see the description of the
  RAB$B_MBC in the VAX Record Management Services Reference Manual.

/BUFFER_COUNT

 /BUFFER_COUNT=count

 Specifies a default  multibuffer  count  for  file  operations.   The
  specified count, representing the number of buffers to be allocated,
  can range from --128 through 127.  A positive value  indicates  that
  the  specified  number  of  buffers  must be locked in the process's
  working set for the I/O operation.  A negative value indicates  that
  the specified number of buffers must be allocated but do not have to
  be locked.

  When you use the /BUFFER_COUNT qualifier, you  can  use  the  /DISK,
  /INDEXED,   /MAGTAPE,   /RELATIVE,   /SEQUENTIAL,  and  /UNIT_RECORD
  qualifiers to specify the types of file for which the default is  to
  be  applied.   If  /BUFFER_COUNT  is  specified without any of these
  qualifiers, /SEQUENTIAL is assumed.

  If you specify 0, RMS uses the process default value.  If this value
  is 0, RMS then uses the system default value.  If the system default
  value is also 0, then RMS uses a value of 1.

  For more information on multibuffer count, see  the  description  of
  the  RAB$B_MBC  in  the  VAX  Record  Management  Services Reference
  Manual.

/DISK

 /DISK

 Indicates that the specified defaults  are  to  be  applied  to  file
  operations  on  disk devices.  If /SEQUENTIAL is specified, /DISK is
  assumed.

/EXTEND_QUANTITY

 /EXTEND_QUANTITY=n

 Specifies the number of blocks (n) to extend a sequential file.   You
  can specify a value from 0 to 65535.

  The /EXTEND_QUANTITY qualifier is used when  the  program  does  not
  specify an extent quantity.

  If you omit the value specification or if you specify a value of  0,
  VAX RMS calculates its own /EXTEND_QUANTITY value.

/INDEXED

 /INDEXED

 Indicates that the specified multibuffer default is to be applied  to
  indexed file operations.

/MAGTAPE

 /MAGTAPE

 Indicates that the specified multibuffer default is to be applied  to
  operations  on  magnetic tape volumes.  If /SEQUENTIAL is specified,
  /MAGTAPE is assumed.

/NETWORK_BLOCK_COUNT

 /NETWORK_BLOCK_COUNT=count

 Specifies  a  default  block  count  for  network  access  to  remote
  sequential, indexed sequential, and relative files.  You can specify
  a value in the range of 0 to 127.

  The network block count value represents the number of  blocks  that
  RMS is prepared to allocate for the I/O buffers used to transmit and
  receive data.  The buffer size used for remote file access, however,
  is  the  result of a negotiation between VAX RMS and the File Access
  Listener (FAL), and the buffer size that is chosen is the smaller of
  the two sizes presented.

  Thus, the /NETWORK_BLOCK_COUNT value places an upper  limit  on  the
  network  buffer  size  that  will  be used.  It also places an upper
  limit on the largest record that may be transferred  to  or  from  a
  remote  file.   In  other  words,  the  largest  record  that can be
  transferred must be less than or equal to this value.

  If you omit the value  or  specify  a  value  of  0,  RMS  uses  the
  system-wide  block count value.  If this value is also 0, RMS uses a
  size of one block.

/PROLOG

 /PROLOG=n

 Specifies a default prolog level for indexed sequential files where n
  is  a  value  of  0, 2, or 3.  A value of 1 is not allowed.  If 0 is
  specified, VAX RMS sets an appropriate prolog level.  By default,  0
  is assumed.

/RELATIVE

 /RELATIVE

 Indicates that the specified multibuffer default is to be applied  to
  file operations on relative files.

/SEQUENTIAL

 /SEQUENTIAL

 Indicates that the specified multibuffer default is to be applied  to
  all  sequential  file  operations,  including  operations  on  disk,
  magnetic tape, and unit record devices.

  The /SEQUENTIAL qualifier is the  default  if  you  do  not  specify
  either /RELATIVE or /INDEXED.

/SYSTEM

 /SYSTEM

 Indicates that  the  specified  defaults  are  to  be  applied  on  a
  system-wide basis to file operations performed by all processes.

  The change-mode-to-kernel (CMKRNL)  privilege  is  required  to  set
  default values for the system.

/UNIT_RECORD

 /UNIT_RECORD

 Indicates that the multibuffer default  is  to  be  applied  to  file
  operations  on  unit  record  devices.  If /SEQUENTIAL is specified,
  /UNIT_RECORD is assumed.

3 Examples
2 TERMINAL
  Changes the system's interpretation of the terminal characteristics.

  Format:

    SET TERMINAL [device-name[:]]
3 Parameters

 device-name[:]

  Specifies the name of the terminal whose characteristics are  to  be
  changed.

  If you do not specify a  device  name,  the  qualifiers  change  the
  characteristics of the current SYS$COMMAND device, if SYS$COMMAND is
  a terminal.  If the current SYS$COMMAND device is  not  a  terminal,
  the system returns an error message.
3 Command_Qualifiers

/ADVANCED_VIDEO

 /ADVANCED_VIDEO
 /NOADVANCED_VIDEO

  Specifies whether the terminal has advanced video attributes and  is
  capable of 132-column mode operation.

  If the terminal width is set to 132 columns and  /ADVANCED_VIDEO  is
  enabled,   the   terminal  page  limit  is  set  to  24  lines.   If
  /NOADVANCED_VIDEO is enabled on a terminal set to 132  columns,  the
  terminal page limit is set to 12 lines.

/ALTYPEAHD

 /ALTYPEAHD
 /NOALTYPEAHD

  Used with the /PERMANENT  qualifier  to  control  the  size  of  the
  type-ahead       buffer.       You      should      specify      SET
  TERMINAL/PERMANENT/ALTYPEAHD in the SYS$SYSTEM:STARTUP.COM for those
  communication lines that require this capability.

  In  order  to  use   this   feature   interactively,   specify   SET
  TERMINAL/PERMANENT/ALTYPEAHD.   This  specification will take effect
  at your next login.

/ANSI_CRT

 /ANSI_CRT
 /NOANSI_CRT

  Specifies whether the terminal  conforms  to  ANSI  CRT  programming
  standards.   The  /ANSI_CRT qualifier indicates that the terminal is
  capable of processing the ANSI sequences listed in the  VAX/VMS  I/O
  User's Reference Manual:  Part I.

  Since  ANSI  standards  are  a  proper   subset   of   the   DEC_CRT
  characteristics,  the  default  for  all  VT100-family  terminals is
  /ANSI_CRT.

/APPLICATION_KEYPAD

 /APPLICATION_KEYPAD

 Specifies that the keypad is to be set to APPLICATION_KEYPAD mode  so
  that  you can use the DEFINE/KEY facility.  By default, the terminal
  is set to /NUMERIC_KEYPAD mode.

/AUTOBAUD

 /AUTOBAUD
 /NOAUTOBAUD

  When used with the /PERMANENT qualifier, controls whether to  enable
  automatic  baud  rate  detection for a terminal line.  Also sets the
  default terminal speed to 9600 baud.

  If you specify /AUTOBAUD, automatic baud rate detection  is  enabled
  allowing the terminal baud rate to be set at login.  You can set the
  baud rate at login by pressing the RETURN  key  two  or  more  times
  separated  by  an  interval  of at least one second.  The valid baud
  rates are:

       110      1200      4800
       150      1800      9600
       300      2400     19200
       600      3600

                                  NOTE

          If you press a  key  other  than  RETURN,  /AUTOBAUD
          might  detect the wrong baud rate.  If this happens,
          wait for the login  procedure  to  time  out  before
          continuing.

/BLOCK_MODE

 /BLOCK_MODE
 /NOBLOCK_MODE

  Specifies whether the terminal is capable of performing  block  mode
  transmission,  local  editing, and field protection.  Terminals that
  support all these functions include the VT131 and VT132.

/BRDCSTMBX

 /BRDCSTMBX
 /NOBRDCSTMBX

  Controls whether  broadcast  messages  are  sent  to  an  associated
  mailbox  if  one  exists.  For a description of message formats, see
  the VAX/VMS I/O User's Reference Manual:  Part I.

/BROADCAST

 /BROADCAST
 /NOBROADCAST

  Controls whether the terminal can receive broadcast messages such as
  MAIL  notifications  and  REPLY  messages.   By  default, a terminal
  receives any messages the system operator or another privileged user
  sends.

  Use the /NOBROADCAST qualifier when you are using a  terminal  as  a
  noninteractive  device  or when you do not want special output to be
  interrupted by messages.  You can use the SET BROADCAST  command  to
  exclude  only certain types of messages from being broadcast to your
  terminal, rather than eliminating all messages.

/CRFILL

 /CRFILL[=formula]

 Specifies whether the system must generate fill characters  following
  the pressing of the RETURN key on the terminal.

  The recommended formula is a number in the  range  of  0  through  9
  indicating  the  number  of  null fill characters required to ensure
  that the RETURN completes successfully before  the  next  meaningful
  character  is sent.  You might need to use this qualifier if you are
  using a non-DIGITAL terminal or a video  terminal.   This  qualifier
  prevents  the  system  from  sending out data before the terminal is
  ready to accept it.

  The default is /CRFILL=0.

/DEC_CRT

 /DEC_CRT[=(value1,value2)]
 /NODEC_CRT[=(value1,value2)]

  Specifies  whether  the  terminal  conforms  to   DEC   VT100-family
  standards  and  supports  the  minimum VT100 standards including DEC
  escape sequences.

  Two optional values may be specified.  A value of  1  requests  that
  the  terminal characteristic, DEC_CRT, be set.  This is the default.
  A value of 2 requests that the terminal characteristic, DEC_CRT2, be
  set.    This   determines  whether  the  terminal  conforms  to  DEC
  VT200-family standards and  supports  the  minimum  VT200  standards
  including additional DEC escape sequences.

  Note that DEC_CRT2 is a superset of DEC_CRT.  Clearing DEC_CRT  will
  cause  DEC_CRT2  to  be  cleared.   Similarly, setting DEC_CRT2 will
  cause DEC_CRT (and ANSI_CRT) to be set.

  For more information, see the VAX/VMS I/O User's  Reference  Manual:
  Part I.

/DEVICE_TYPE

 /DEVICE_TYPE=terminal-type

 Informs the system of the  terminal  type.   When  you  specify  this
  qualifier,  the  terminal  sets  the default characteristics for the
  specified terminal.  The default characteristics for  each  type  of
  terminal  are  listed  in  Table  15  in the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary.  
  That table also  shows which characteristics are valid for each type 
  of terminal.

  You can specify any of the following terminal types:

       UNKNOWN          LA34
       FT1 - FT8        LA38
       LA12             LA100
       LA36             LQP02
       LA120            VT125
       VT05             VT131
       VT52             VT132
       VT55             VT173
       VT100            VT200
       VT101            PRO_SERIES
       VT102
       VT105
  For compatibility reasons terminal types listed in the first  column
  can  be  specified  as qualifiers by themselves (for example, /FT8).
  However, you are encouraged to use the /DEVICE_TYPE qualifier.

  Terminal  types  FT1  through  FT8  permit  up  to  eight  different
  categories  of  terminals  that  are  not  supported  by  VMS  to be
  identified  as  foreign  terminals.   See  the  VAX/VMS  I/O  User's
  Reference  Manual:   Part  I  to find out how to obtain the terminal
  type from a user program.  When you specify a foreign terminal  type
  (FTn), you do not change the default characteristics established for
  the terminal.

/DIALUP

 /DIALUP
 /NODIALUP

  Specifies that the terminal is a dialup terminal.   The  default  is
  /NODIALUP.

/DISCONNECT

 /DISCONNECT
 /NODISCONNECT

  Specifies that  the  process  connected  to  this  terminal  not  be
  discontinued   if  the  line  detects  a  hangup.   The  /DISCONNECT
  qualifier is valid only when /PERMANENT is specified.   The  default
  state is /NODISCONNECT.  For more information on process connection,
  see the CONNECT and DISCONNECT commands.

/DISMISS

 /DISMISS
 /NODISMISS

  Determines the terminal driver's treatment of parity errors.  If you
  specify  /DISMISS,  the  terminal  driver  will ignore the data that
  caused the error.  When /NODISMISS, the default, is in  effect,  the
  terminal  driver  terminates  the  currently outstanding I/O with an
  error status.

/DMA

 /DMA
 /NODMA

  Controls the use of direct memory access (DMA) mode on a  controller
  that   supports   this   feature.   The  default  is  /DMA  for  DMA
  controllers, and /NODMA for non-DMA controllers.

/ECHO

 /ECHO
 /NOECHO

  Controls whether the terminal echoes (that is, displays)  the  input
  lines that it receives.

  When /NOECHO is set, the terminal displays only data that  a  system
  or user application program writes to it.  The default is /ECHO.

/EDIT_MODE

 /EDIT_MODE
 /NOEDIT_MODE

  Specifies whether the terminal is capable of performing ANSI defined
  advanced editing functions.

/EIGHT_BIT

 /EIGHT_BIT
 /NOEIGHT_BIT

  Indicates whether the terminal uses  an  eight-bit  ASCII  character
  code.

  The default is /NOEIGHT_BIT for  all  terminals,  except  the  VT200
  Series;  the  terminal  interprets  characters using seven-bit ASCII
  code.

/ESCAPE

 /ESCAPE
 /NOESCAPE

  Controls whether ANSI standard escape sequences transmitted from the
  terminal are handled as a single multiple-character terminator.  The
  default is /NOESCAPE.

  If you specify the /ESCAPE qualifier, the terminal driver checks the
  escape sequences for syntax before passing them to the program.  For
  information  on  escape  sequences,  see  the  VAX/VMS  I/O   User's
  Reference Manual:  Part I.

/FALLBACK

 /FALLBACK
 /NOFALLBACK

  Specifies that eight-bit DEC Multinational Character Set  characters
  be displayed on the terminal in their seven-bit representation.  The
  default depends on the /EIGHTBIT setting of the terminal.

/FRAME

 /FRAME=n

 Controls the number of data bits that the terminal driver expects for
  every character that is input or output.  The default depends on the
  /PARITY and /EIGHTBIT settings of the terminal.  The n parameter can
  take a value from 5 through 8.

/FORM

 /FORM
 /NOFORM

  Controls whether the terminal driver translates form-feed characters
  into  one  or  more  line  feeds  or merely outputs the untranslated
  form-feed character.

/FULLDUP

 /FULLDUP
 /NOFULLDUP

  Specifies whether the terminal's mode of operation is full-duplex or
  half-duplex.

  For a description of these modes of operation, see the  VAX/VMS  I/O
  User's Reference Manual:  Part I.

  This qualifier is complementary to the /HALFDUP qualifier, that  is,
  /FULLDUP is equivalent to /NOHALFDUP.

/HALFDUP

 /HALFDUP
 /NOHALFDUP

  Specifies whether the terminal's mode of operation is full-duplex or
  half-duplex.

  For a description of these modes of operation, see the  VAX/VMS  I/O
  User's Reference Manual:  Part I.

  This qualifier is complementary to the /FULLDUP qualifier, that  is,
  /HALFDUP is equivalent to /NOFULLDUP.

/HANGUP

 /HANGUP
 /NOHANGUP

  Controls whether the terminal modem is hung up when you log out.  In
  order  to  specify  /HANGUP,  you  might  require  LOG_IO  or PHY_IO
  privilege  depending   on   parameters   specified   during   system
  generation.  The default is /NOHANGUP.

/HARDCOPY

 /HARDCOPY
 /NOHARDCOPY

  Indicates whether the terminal is a hard-copy or video terminal.  It
  also  affects  how  the terminal interprets certain input keys.  The
  /HARDCOPY qualifier establishes the terminal as a hard-copy  device.
  Thus,  the  DELETE  (or  RUBOUT)  key  cannot  accomplish  backspace
  deletions.  Instead, a backslash character is output each  time  the
  DELETE key is pressed.

  This qualifier is complementary to the /SCOPE  qualifier;  that  is,
  /HARDCOPY is equivalent to /NOSCOPE.

/HOSTSYNC

 /HOSTSYNC
 /NOHOSTSYNC

  Controls whether the system can synchronize the flow of  input  from
  the terminal.

  When you specify the /HOSTSYNC qualifier,  the  system  generates  a
  CTRL/S  or  a  CTRL/Q  to  enable or disable the reception of input.
  When the type-ahead buffer is full, the system  sends  a  CTRL/S  to
  temporarily stop input; when the buffer is empty, the system sends a
  CTRL/Q so  that  more  input  can  be  entered.   The  size  of  the
  type-ahead buffer is established using system generation parameters.
  The default is /NOHOSTSYNC.

/INQUIRE

 /INQUIRE

 Requests a response sequence from  DIGITAL  terminals  and  sets  the
  device type according to the response.  Some VT100-family terminals,
  including the VT101 and VT105, return a VT100-type  response.   LA38
  terminals respond as LA34 terminals.

  You can include the SET TERMINAL/INQUIRE command in  your  LOGIN.COM
  file to automatically detect the terminal type.

                                CAUTION

          This qualifier clears the type-ahead buffer.  If the
          response sequence is unrecognized, no action message
          or  error  message  is  displayed.    The   /INQUIRE
          qualifier  should be used only on DIGITAL terminals.
          However, the LA36 and VT05 terminals do not  support
          this feature.

/INSERT

 /INSERT

 Sets the terminal to /INSERT mode.  This feature allows you to insert
  characters  when you are editing command lines.  The default mode is
  /OVERSTRIKE, which allows you to type  over  the  current  character
  when you are editing a command line.

/INTERACTIVE

 /INTERACTIVE
 /NOINTERACTIVE

  Indicates that the terminal is in use as an interactive terminal.

  This qualifier is complementary to the /PASSALL qualifier, that  is,
  /INTERACTIVE   is   equivalent   to   /NOPASSALL.   The  default  is
  /INTERACTIVE.

/LFFILL

 /LFFILL[=formula]

 Specifies whether the system must generate fill characters  following
  a line feed on the terminal.

  The recommended formula value is  a  number  in  the  range  from  0
  through  9 indicating the number of null fill characters required to
  ensure that the line feed completes  successfully  before  the  next
  meaningful  character is read.  You might need to use this qualifier
  if you are using a non-DIGITAL terminal or a video terminal.

  This qualifier prevents the system from sending out data before  the
  terminal is ready to accept it.

  The default is installation-dependent (see Table 15 in  the  VAX/VMS
  DCL Dictionary).

/LINE_EDITING

 /LINE_EDITING
 /NOLINE_EDITING

  Enables the advanced  line  editing  features  for  editing  command
  lines.

  If you specify /LINE_EDITING, both RETURN and CTRL/Z are  recognized
  as  line  terminators.   Escape  sequences  are also enabled as line
  terminators.  The default is installation-dependent (see Table 15 in
  the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary).

/LOCAL_ECHO

 /LOCAL_ECHO
 /NOLOCAL_ECHO

  When used with the /ECHO qualifier, controls  whether  the  terminal
  echoes  characters  locally  rather than relying on the host to echo
  them.

  Local echo  mode  is  supported  only  for  command  level  terminal
  functions.   Certain  utilities  that  require control over echoing,
  such as the EDT editor in screen  mode,  should  not  be  used  with
  /LOCAL_ECHO set.

                                CAUTION

          When logging in to terminals with  /LOCAL_ECHO  set,
          VMS has no control over the echoing of passwords.

/LOWERCASE

 /LOWERCASE
 /NOLOWERCASE

  Indicates  whether  the  terminal  has   uppercase   and   lowercase
  characters.

  If  you  specify  /NOLOWERCASE,  all  letters  that  are  input  are
  translated  to  uppercase.   If  you  specify  /LOWERCASE, lowercase
  characters are not converted to uppercase.

  This qualifier is complementary to the  /UPPERCASE  qualifier,  that
  is, /LOWERCASE is equivalent to /NOUPPERCASE.

/MODEM

 /MODEM
 /NOMODEM

  Indicates whether the terminal is connected to a modem  or  a  cable
  that  supplies  standard  EIA  modem  control  signals.  The VAX/VMS
  operating system automatically interprets  modem  signals.   If  the
  terminal  is  set to /MODEM and you enter SET TERMINAL /NOMODEM, you
  are automatically logged out.

/NUMERIC_KEYPAD

 /NUMERIC_KEYPAD

 Specifies that the keypad is to be set  to  /NUMERIC_KEYPAD  mode  so
  that  you can use the keys on the numeric keypad to type numbers and
  punctuation  marks.   By   default,   the   terminal   is   set   to
  /NUMERIC_KEYPAD  mode.  In order to use the DEFINE/KEY facility, you
  must set the terminal to /APPLICATION_KEYPAD.

/OVERSTRIKE

 /OVERSTRIKE

 Sets the terminal to /OVERSTRIKE mode.  This feature  allows  you  to
  type over the current character when you are editing a command line.
  You can set your terminal to /INSERT if  you  want  to  be  able  to
  insert characters when editing command lines.

/PAGE

 /PAGE[=n]

 Specifies the page length of the terminal.  For hard-copy  terminals,
  the  page  size  (n)  equals  the  number  of  print  lines  between
  perforations on the paper.  When the  terminal  reads  a  form  feed
  character,  it  advances  the paper to the next perforation.  A page
  size of 0 indicates that the terminal treats each formfeed as a line
  feed.

  You can specify values of 0 through 255  for  the  page  size.   The
  default  size  is  installation-dependent.   However, if you specify
  /PAGE without a value, the default value for n is 0.

/PARITY

 /PARITY[=option]
 /NOPARITY

  Defines the parity for the terminal.  You can specify either of  the
  following options:

       EVEN
       ODD

  If you use the /PARITY qualifier without an option, the SET TERMINAL
  command assumes /PARITY=EVEN.  The default is /NOPARITY.

/PASSALL

 /PASSALL
 /NOPASSALL

  Controls whether all input and output data is in 7 or  8-bit  binary
  format  (no  data  interpretation occurs).  Data terminiation occurs
  when the buffer is full or  the  read  data  matches  the  specified
  terminiator.   Terminal  lines  that have this characteristic cannot
  receive broadcast messages.

  This qualifier is complementary to the /INTERACTIVE qualifier,  that
  is,  /PASSALL  is  equivalent  to  /NOINTERACTIVE.   The  default is
  /INTERACTIVE.

/PASTHRU

 /PASTHRU
 /NOPASTHRU

  Controls whether the system interprets special characters or  passes
  all data to an application program as binary data.

  A terminal operating  in  PASTHRU  mode  does  not  (1)  expand  tab
  characters  to  spaces,  (2)  fill  carriage  return  or  line  feed
  characters, or (3) recognize other control characters.  The  setting
  of /TTSYNC is honored.

  The default is /NOPASTHRU.

/PERMANENT

 /PERMANENT

 Controls whether the characteristics that you specify are established
  permanently  or  only  for the current terminal session.  By default
  the characteristics that you set during a session are in effect only
  for that session.

  The permanent characteristics are restored  when  the  current  user
  logs  out.   If  you  use  the  /PERMANENT qualifier to override the
  system default  characteristics  established  at  system  generation
  time,   remember  that  if  the  system  is  halted,  the  permanent
  characteristics revert to those defined at system generation.

  You can use the /PERMANENT qualifier with the SET  TERMINAL  command
  in  a  system start-up file to establish the characteristics for all
  terminals on the system.

  You must have the LOG_IO or PHY_IO user  privilege  to  specify  the
  /PERMANENT qualifier.

/PRINTER_PORT

 /PRINTER_PORT
 /NOPRINTER_PORT

  Specifies that the terminal has  a  printer  port  available.   This
  terminal attribute is not set automatically by SET TERMINAL/INQUIRE.
  The default is installation-dependent (see Table 15 in  the  VAX/VMS
  DCL Dictionary).

/PROTOCOL

 /PROTOCOL=DDCMP
 /PROTOCOL=NONE

  Controls whether the terminal port  specified  is  changed  into  an
  asynchronous DDCMP line.  Use the /PROTOCOL=NONE qualifier to change
  an asynchronous DDCMP line back into a terminal line.

  For more information on how to use these lines with DECNET, refer to
  the Guide to Networking on VAX/VMS.

/READSYNC

 /READSYNC
 /NOREADSYNC

  Controls whether the system solicits read data from a terminal using
  CTRL/Q and terminates the read using CTRL/S.

  The default is /NOREADSYNC; the  system  does  not  use  CTRL/S  and
  CTRL/Q to control reads to the terminal.  The /READSYNC qualifier is
  useful for certain classes of terminals that demand  synchronization
  or  for special-purpose terminal lines where data synchronization is
  appropriate.

/REGIS

 /REGIS
 /NOREGIS

  Specifies whether the terminal understands REGIS  graphic  commands.
  This  qualifier  is  set  for  VT125  terminals, which have graphics
  capabilities.

/SCOPE

 /SCOPE
 /NOSCOPE

  Indicates whether the terminal is a video terminal, and thus how  it
  reacts   when  certain  keys  are  pressed.   The  /SCOPE  qualifier
  establishes the terminal as a video terminal.  Thus, when you  press
  the  DELETE  key, the printing position is moved left one column and
  the character displayed in that position is erased.

  This qualifier is complementary to the /HARDCOPY qualifier, that is,
  /SCOPE is equivalent to /NOHARDCOPY.

/SET_SPEED

 /SET_SPEED
 /NOSET_SPEED

  Controls whether the /SPEED qualifier can  be  used  to  change  the
  terminal  speed.   To  reset the speed, use the /SET_SPEED qualifier
  and the /SPEED qualifier.

  In order to use this qualifier,  you  must  have  either  LOG_IO  or
  PHY_IO privilege.

/SECURE_SERVER

 /SECURE_SERVER
 /NOSECURE_SERVER

  Determines whether the BREAK  key  on  the  terminal  logs  out  the
  current  process.  With /SECURE_SERVER in effect, pressing the BREAK
  key when there is no current process initiates the  login  sequence.
  By default, the BREAK key has no effect.

  The /SECURE_SERVER qualifier has no effect on terminals that are set
  with /AUTOBAUD.

/SIXEL_GRAPHICS

 /SIXEL_GRAPHICS
 /NOSIXEL_GRAPHICS

  Controls whether the terminal  is  capable  of  displaying  graphics
  using  the  REGIS-defined  SIXEL  graphics protocol.  The default is
  device-dependent, see Table 15 in the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary.

/SOFT_CHARACTERS

 /SOFT_CHARACTERS
 /NOSOFT_CHARACTERS

  Controls  whether  the  terminal  has  the  capability  to  load   a
  user-defined  character  set.   The default is device-dependent, see
  Table 15 in the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary.

/SPEED

 /SPEED=rate

 Specifies the rate at which the terminal sends and receives data.

  If you specify the rate as a single value, the input and output baud
  rates  are  set  to the same speed.  To specify different baud rates
  for input and output, specify the rate in  the  format  (n,m).   The
  values  n  and  m  indicate  the input (terminal to host) and output
  (host to terminal) baud  rates,  respectively.   Not  all  terminals
  support  different  input  and  output  baud  rates.   For  specific
  information on baud rates for your terminal, consult the manual  for
  that terminal.

  The default transmission rates are installation-dependent.

  The valid values for input and output baud rates are:

        50           150          1800           4800
        75           300          2000           7200
       110           600          2400           9600
       134          1200          3600          19200

                                  NOTE

          Some speeds are not supported on certain  terminals.
          For  a  list  of  speeds  supported  on a particular
          terminal,    see    the     appropriate     hardware
          documentation.

/SYSPASSWORD

 /SYSPASSWORD
 /NOSYSPASSWORD

  Determines whether the terminal requires that a system  password  be
  entered  before  the USERNAME:  prompt is displayed.  This qualifier
  requires LOG_IO privilege and should be used in conjunction with the
  /PERMANENT qualifier.

  For more information, see the Guide to VAX/VMS System Security.

/TAB

 /TAB
 /NOTAB

  Controls how  the  terminal  handles  tab  characters.   The  /NOTAB
  qualifier expands all tab characters to spaces and assumes tab stops
  at eight-character intervals.

  Use the /TAB qualifier when you do not want the  system  to  convert
  tabs to spaces, but want the terminal to process the tab characters.
  VMS  requires  that  terminals  expand   tabs   at   eight-character
  intervals.   The  default  is  device-dependent, see Table 15 in the
  VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary.

/TTSYNC

 /TTSYNC
 /NOTTSYNC

  Controls whether the system responds to a CTRL/S  or  CTRL/Q  issued
  from the terminal in order to synchronize output.

  The default is /TTSYNC; the system stops sending output when  CTRL/S
  is sent by the terminal and resumes output when a CTRL/Q is sent.

/TYPE_AHEAD

 /TYPE_AHEAD
 /NOTYPE_AHEAD

  Controls whether the terminal accepts unsolicited  input,  that  is,
  input that you type when there is no outstanding read.

  When you specify /NOTYPE_AHEAD, the terminal is dedicated, and  will
  accept  input only when a program or the system issues a read to the
  terminal.

  Use the /NOTYPE_AHEAD qualifier to ensure that a  specific  terminal
  remains  dedicated to a particular application.  Logins are disabled
  on a terminal with /NOTYPE_AHEAD set.

  When you specify  /TYPE_AHEAD,  the  amount  of  data  that  can  be
  accepted  is  governed  by  the size of the type-ahead buffer.  That
  size is determined by system generation parameters.  The default  is
  /TYPE_AHEAD.

/UNKNOWN

 /UNKNOWN

 Indicates that the system does not recognize the terminal type.  When
  you  specify  this  qualifier,  the system uses the default terminal
  characteristics  for  unknown  terminals.   For  a  summary  of  the
  settings,  see  Table  15  in  the  VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary.

/UPPERCASE

 /UPPERCASE
 /NOUPPERCASE

  Specifies whether or not the terminal  should  translate  all  input
  lowercase letters to uppercase.

  This qualifier is complementary to the  /LOWERCASE  qualifier,  that
  is, /UPPERCASE is equivalent to /NOLOWERCASE.

/WIDTH

 /WIDTH=n

 Specifies the number of characters on each input or output line.  The
  width value must be in the range 0 through 255.

  If the specified width on an ANSI terminal is 132, the screen is set
  to 132-character mode.  If the terminal does not have advanced video
  option (AVO), the page length limit is set to 12 lines.

  When the /WRAP qualifier is in  effect,  the  terminal  generates  a
  carriage  return/line  feed  when a line reaches the column position
  specified by the width value.

/WRAP

 /WRAP
 /NOWRAP

  Controls  whether  or  not  the  terminal   generates   a   carriage
  return/line  feed when it reaches the end of the line.  The end of a
  line is determined by the setting of the terminal width.

  If you specify /NOWRAP and the  terminal  is  accepting  input,  the
  terminal  does  not  generate  a  carriage  return/line feed when it
  reaches the end of a line, but continues to accept input at the last
  physical  character  position  on the terminal line.  If you specify
  /NOWRAP and the terminal is writing output, it  continues  to  write
  characters out until it reaches the last position on the line.

  When you specify the  /WRAP  qualifier,  the  terminal  generates  a
  carriage  return/line  feed whenever the end of the line is reached.
  /WRAP is the default.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET TERMINAL/DEVICE=VT102

  This SET TERMINAL command establishes  the  current  terminal  as  a
  VT102  terminal  and  sets  the  default  characteristics  for  that
  terminal type.

  2.   $ SET TERMINAL/WIDTH=132/PAGE=60/NOBROADCAST
       $ TYPE MEMO.DOC
           .
           .
           .

       $ SET TERMINAL/DEVICE=LA36

  The first SET TERMINAL command indicates that the width of  terminal
  lines  is 132 characters and that the size of each page is 60 lines.
  The /NOBROADCAST  qualifier  disables  the  reception  of  broadcast
  messages while the terminal is printing the file MEMO.DOC.  The next
  SET TERMINAL command restores the terminal to its default state.
2 TIME
  Resets  the  system  time.   The  system  time  is  used   for   all
  time-dependent activities in the VAX/VMS operating system.

  Format:

    SET TIME[=time]
3 Parameters

 time

  The VAX/VMS system contains an interval clock, which is used both as
  a  timer  to record intervals between various internal events and as
  the source clock for displaying the time of day.

  The SET TIME command allows you to reset the system time.   However,
  both  OPER  (operator)  and  LOG_IO  (logical  I/O)  privileges  are
  required.

  To reset the system time, type  the  SET  TIME  command,  optionally
  followed  by  an  explicit  time  value  expressed  in  the standard
  absolute time format, described below.  If the explicit  time  value
  is  specified,  the  interval  system  clock  is  reset  to the time
  specified.

  The date, the time, or both can be specified.  The following  format
  is used to specify the absolute time parameter:

       [dd-mmm-yyyy[:]] [hh:mm:ss.cc]


  Field  Description


  dd     Day of the month (1 through 31)

  mmm    Month;  must  be  specified  using  one  of  the  3-character
         abbreviations listed below:

              JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN
              JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC

  yyyy   Year

  hh     Hour of the day (0 through 23)

  mm     Minute of the hour (0 through 59)

  ss     Seconds (0 through 59)

  cc     Hundredths of seconds (0 through 99)

  Note that the period between seconds and hundredths of seconds is  a
  delimiter;  it  is  not a decimal point.  For further information on
  absolute time format, see Section 2.5 in the  VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary 
  (or access the HELP topic SPECIFY).

  If the explicit time value is not  specified,  the  interval  system
  clock is automatically reset according to the Time-of-year clock.

  Note that the Time-of-year clock is optional  for  some  processors.
  For  further  information  about the Time-of-year clock, see the VAX
  Hardware Handbook.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET TIME = 3:21:24.03

       $ SHOW TIME

       19-JUN-1982 3:22:19.53

  The SET TIME command sets the system time  to  the  specified  time.
  The SHOW TIME command requests a display of the current time.

  2.   $ SET TIME

       $ SHOW TIME

       19-JUN-1982 3:21:27.53

  The  SET  TIME  command  sets  the  system  time  according  to  the
  Time-of-year clock.  The SHOW TIME command requests a display of the
  current time.
2 UIC
  Establishes a new user identification code  (UIC)  as  the  default.
  Use  the  SET  UIC command to gain access to a restricted file, that
  is, a file contained  in  a  directory  whose  protection  restricts
  access to the owner of that directory.

  Format:

    SET UIC uic
3 Parameters

 uic

  Specifies the group number and member number.  Specify the UIC using
  standard  UIC  format  as  described in Section 3.7.1 in the VAX/VMS
  DCL Dictionary (or access the HELP topic SPECIFY).

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET UIC [370,10]

  This command establishes your UIC as [370,10].  You can now read  or
  modify any files whose access is restricted to this UIC.

  2.   $ SET UIC [214,4]
       $ SET DEFAULT [ANDERSON]

  The SET UIC command sets  your  UIC  to  [214,4];  the  SET  DEFAULT
  command sets the default directory name to [ANDERSON].

  3.   $ SET UIC [GEORGE]

  This example sets the UIC to be that of the user named GEORGE who is
  a  member  of  the  same  group  as  the  person issuing the SET UIC
  command.  Note the similarity of this UIC format  to  the  directory
  name   format.   Be  sure  not  to  use  a  UIC  where  a  directory
  specification is needed.

  4.   $ SET UIC [VMS,GEORGE]

  This example sets the UIC to be that of the user named GEORGE who is
  a  member  of the VMS group.  The person issuing the SET UIC command
  need not be a member of the VMS group.
2 VERIFY
  Controls whether command lines and data lines in command  procedures
  are  either displayed at the terminal or printed in a batch job log.
  The information displayed by the SET VERIFY command can help you  in
  debugging command procedures.

  Format:

    SET [NO]VERIFY [=([NO]PROCEDURE, [NO]IMAGE)]
3 Parameters

 ([NO]PROCEDURE, [NO]IMAGE)

  Specifies one or both types of verification.  Procedure verification
  causes each DCL command line in a command procedure to be written to
  the output device.  Image verification causes data lines (input data
  that  is  included  as  part  of  the  SYS$INPUT input stream) to be
  written to the output device.

  If you do not specify either of the verification keywords, then both
  types of verification are set (with SET VERIFY) or cleared (with SET
  NOVERIFY).  If you specify  only  one  keyword,  then  the  type  of
  verification  you  specify  is  set or cleared; the other one is not
  affected.  Also, when you specify only one keyword, you can omit the
  parentheses.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET VERIFY
       $ INDEX == "$INDEX.EXE
       $ CONTENTS == "$CONTENTS.EXE
       $ TABLE == "$TABLE.EXE
       $ SET NOVERIFY
       $ EXIT

  Procedure and image verification are turned on at the  beginning  of
  the  command  procedure  so  that  the  system  will display all the
  command and data lines in the procedure as it reads  them.   At  the
  end  of  the procedure, the SET NOVERIFY command restores the system
  default (no procedure or image verification).

  2.   $ PROC_VER = F$ENVIRONMENT("VERIFY_PROCEDURE")
       $ IMAGE_VER = F$ENVIRONMENT("VERIFY_IMAGE")
       $ SET NOVERIFY
          .
          .
          .
       $ TEMP = F$VERIFY(PROC_VER, IMAGE_VER)

  This command procedure uses the lexical  function  F$ENVIRONMENT  to
  save the current procedure and image verification setting.  Then the
  SET  NOVERIFY  command  turns   off   both   procedure   and   image
  verification.   Subsequently,  the  F$VERIFY  function  is  used  to
  restore the original verification settings.

  3.   $ SET VERIFY
       $ @TEST
       $ RUN AVERAGE
       1
       2
       3
       $ EXIT

  In this example, the SET VERIFY command turns  procedure  and  image
  verification  on.   When  the command procedure TEST.COM is executed
  interactively, the command lines and the data lines for the  program
  AVERAGE  are displayed on the terminal.  The data lines were entered
  in the command procedure on lines that did not begin  with  the  DCL
  prompt.

  4.   $ SET VERIFY = PROCEDURE

  In this example, procedure verification  is  turned  on.   If  image
  verification was previously on, it remains on; if image verification
  was off, it remains off.

  5.   $ SET VERIFY
       $ COUNT = 1
       $ IF P'COUNT' .NES. "" THEN GOTO &P'COUNT'
          .
          .
          .
       $ EXIT

  When this command  procedure  is  executed  interactively,  the  SET
  VERIFY  command  causes  the command and data lines to be displayed.
  Symbols that are  substituted  during  the  first  phase  of  symbol
  substitution  (such  as  'COUNT')  are  displayed  by the SET VERIFY
  command, but  other  symbols  are  not.   The  following  lines  are
  displayed when this procedure is executed interactively:

       $ COUNT = 1
       $ IF P1 .NES. "" THEN GOTO &P1
          .
          .
          .

  Although these values  are  not  displayed,  the  value  for  P1  is
  substituted  during  the third phase of symbol substitution, and the
  value for &P1 is substituted during the second phase.
2 VOLUME
  Modifies  the  characteristics  of  one  or  more  mounted  Files-11
  volumes.

  Format:

    SET VOLUME device-spec[:][,...]
3 Parameters

 device-name[:][,...]

  Specifies the name of one or more mounted Files-11 volumes.
3 Command_Qualifiers

/ACCESSED

 /ACCESSED[=n]

 Specifies the number of directories to be maintained in system  space
  for  ready  access.  If you specify a value greater than the current
  value, the new value is  effective  immediately.   However,  if  you
  specify  a  value that is less than the current value, the new value
  is written to the home block and will not take effect until the next
  time the volume is mounted.

  You can specify a number (n) in the range of 0 through 255.  If  you
  specify  the qualifier /ACCESSED and omit the number of directories,
  a default value of 3 is used.

  You must  have  OPER  (operator)  privilege  to  use  the  /ACCESSED
  qualifier.

/DATA_CHECK

 /DATA_CHECK[=(option[,...])]

 Defines a default for  data  check  operations  following  all  reads
  and/or  writes  to  the  specified  volume.   You  can  specify  the
  following options:

  [NO]READ Determines whether checking is performed following all read
         operations.

  [NO]WRITE Determines whether checking  is  performed  following  all
         write operations.

  If you specify  the  /DATA_CHECK  qualifier  without  specifying  an
  option,  the  default  qualifier  /DATA_CHECK=WRITE is used.  If you
  omit the /DATA_CHECK qualifier, no checking is performed.

/ERASE_ON_DELETE

 /ERASE_ON_DELETE
 /NOERASE_ON_DELETE

  Specifies that when a file on  the  volume  is  deleted,  the  space
  occupied by that file is erased.  The default is /NOERASE_ON_DELETE.
  For  more  information  on  how  the  erasing  is  done,   see   the
  DELETE/ERASE command.

/EXTENSION

 /EXTENSION[=n]

 Specifies the number of blocks to be used as a default extension size
  for  all  files  on the volume.  You can specify a number (n) in the
  range of 0 through 65535.  If you specify the  /EXTENSION  qualifier
  without  specifying  a  value,  a  default  value  of 0 (the VAX RMS
  default) is used.

  For example, during an update operation, the  extension  default  is
  used  when  a  file  increases  to  a  size greater than its initial
  default allocation.

/FILE_PROTECTION

 /FILE_PROTECTION=(code)

 Specifies the default protection to be applied to all  files  on  the
  specified  volume.  Specify the code according to the rules given in
  Section 3.7 in the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary.

  Note that this attribute is not used while the volume is in use on a
  VAX/VMS  system,  but  is provided to control the process use of the
  volume on RSX-11M systems.  VAX/VMS always  uses  the  default  file
  protection;  the  protection can be changed with the DCL command SET
  PROTECTION/DEFAULT.

/HIGHWATER_MARKING

 /HIGHWATER_MARKING
 /NOHIGHWATER_MARKING

  Specifies that all files on the disk  volume  are  subject  to  file
  highwater  marking.   This  qualifier  is  applicable  to ODS-2 disk
  volumes only.

  If  you  specify  /HIGHWATER_MARKING,  SET  VOLUME  sets  the   File
  Highwater  Mark  (FHM)  volume  attribute.   FHM is a mechanism that
  guarantees that a user cannot read data that he has not written.

  The /NOHIGHWATER_MARKING qualifier disables FHM for the volume.

/LABEL

 /LABEL=volume-label

 Specifies a 1- through 12-character alphanumeric name to  be  encoded
  on  the  volume.   Lowercase  letters  are  automatically changed to
  uppercase.  The specified  label  remains  in  effect  until  it  is
  explicitly  changed (that is, dismounting the volume does not effect
  the label).

/LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

  Controls  whether  the  SET  VOLUME  command  displays  the   volume
  specification of each volume after the modification.

  By default, the SET VOLUME command does not display the names of the
  volumes after they are modified.

/MOUNT_VERIFICATION

 /MOUNT_VERIFICATION
 /NOMOUNT_VERIFICATION

  Specifies whether the volume is subject to mount verification.

/OWNER_UIC

 /OWNER_UIC[=uic]

 Sets the owner UIC of the volume to the specified UIC.   Specify  the
  UIC  using  standard UIC format as described in Section 3.7.1 in the
  VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary (or access the HELP topic SPECIFY).

  If you specify the /OWNER_UIC qualifier without  specifying  a  UIC,
  the current process UIC is used.

/PROTECTION

 /PROTECTION=(code)

 Specifies the protection to be applied to the volume.  The protection
  controls  who  can  read, write, and delete files on the volume.  If
  you do not specify a protection code,  protection  defaults  to  all
  access of all categories of user.  Specify the code according to the
  rules given in Section 3.7 in the VAX/VMS DCL Dictionary.

  When  you  specify  a  protection  code,  access  type  E  (execute)
  indicates create access.

/REBUILD

 /REBUILD

 Recovers caching limits for a volume that was improperly dismounted.

  If a disk volume was dismounted improperly (such as during a  system
  failure),  and  was then remounted with the MOUNT/NOREBUILD command,
  you can use SET VOLUME/REBUILD to recover the caching  that  was  in
  effect at the time of the dismount.

/RETENTION

 /RETENTION=(min[,max])

 Specifies the minimum (min) and maximum (max) retention times  to  be
  used  by  the file system to determine the expiration date for files
  on the volume.

  When a file is  created  on  the  volume,  the  expiration  date  is
  initially  set  to  the  current  time + max.  Each time the file is
  accessed, the current time is added to the min time, and if this sum
  is  greater  than  the  expiration  date,  a  new expiration date is
  computed.

  If you omit the max value, a default value that is the smaller of (2
  x min) or (min + 7) days is used.  For example, /RETENTION=3- is the
  same as /RETENTION=(3-,6-), while  /RETENTION=10-  is  the  same  as
  /RETENTION=(10-,17-).

/UNLOAD

 /UNLOAD
 /NOUNLOAD

  Specifies whether the volume is unloaded (that is, spun  down)  when
  the DCL command DISMOUNT is issued.

/USER_NAME

 /USER_NAME[=user-name]

 Specifies a user name of up  to  12  alphanumeric  characters  to  be
  recorded  on  the  volume.   If you specify the /USER_NAME qualifier
  without specifying a user name, the current  process  user  name  is
  used.

/WINDOWS

 /WINDOWS[=n]

 Specifies the number of mapping pointers to  be  allocated  for  file
  windows.  You can specify a number (n) in the range 7 through 80.

  If you specify the /WINDOWS qualifier without specifying a number, a
  default value of 7 is used.

3 Examples

  1.   $ SET VOLUME/DATA_CHECK=(READ,WRITE) DBC5

  This command requests that data checks be  performed  following  all
  read and write operations to DBC5.

  2.   $ SET VOLUME/FILE_PROTECTION=(S:RWED,O:RWED,G:RE,W:RE) DBC5

  This command sets the default protection to be applied to all  files
  created  on  volume DBC5.  System and owner are granted all types of
  access; group and world are permitted only to read and execute files
  on DBC5.

  3.   $ SET VOLUME/LABEL=LICENSES DBC5

  This command encodes the label LICENSES on the  volume  DBC5.   Note
  that  if  characters  in  labels  are entered in lowercase, they are
  changed to uppercase by the /LABEL qualifier.

  4.   $ SET VOLUME/ACCESSED=25/USER_NAME=MANAGER/LOG DBA0:

  This command specifies that 25 directories are to be  maintained  in
  system  space  for  ready  access for the volume DBA0:.  The command
  also assigns the user name MANAGER to the volume  and  displays  the
  volume specification after the volume is modified.

  5.   $ SET VOLUME/REBUILD/LOG NODE$DBA2:
       SET-I-MODIFIED, _NODE$DBA2: modified

  The SET VOLUME/REBUILD command causes a rebuild operation  to  begin
  on  the  volume  that  is mounted on NODE$DBA2:.  The /LOG qualifier
  directs SET VOLUME to display a notification message.
2 WORKING_SET
  Redefines the default working set size for the process  or  sets  an
  upper limit to which the working set size can be changed by an image
  that the process executes.

  Format:

    SET WORKING_SET
3 Command_Qualifiers

/ADJUST

 /ADJUST
 /NOADJUST

  Enables or disables the system's changing  of  the  process  working
  set.  The default is /ADJUST.

/EXTENT

 /EXTENT=n

 Specifies the maximum number of pages that can  be  resident  in  the
  working set during image execution.

  The extent value must  be  greater  than  the  minimum  working  set
  defined  at  system  generation and it must be less than or equal to
  the authorized extent defined in the user authorization file.

  If you specify a value  greater  than  the  authorized  extent,  the
  command sets the working set limit at the maximum authorized value.

/LIMIT

 /LIMIT=n

 Specifies the size to which the working set is to be reduced at image
  exit.

  If you specify a value greater than the  current  quota,  the  quota
  value is also increased.

/LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

  Determines whether  or  not  confirmation  of  the  SET  WORKING_SET
  command is displayed.  By default, no log information is displayed.

/QUOTA

 /QUOTA=n

 Specifies the maximum number of pages that any image executing in the
  process  context can request.  An image can set the working set size
  for the process by calling the Adjust Working  Set  Limit  ($ADJWSL)
  system  service,  which  is described in the VAX/VMS System Routines
