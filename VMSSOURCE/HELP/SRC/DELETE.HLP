1 DELETE

  The DELETE commands perform the following functions:

  o  Delete one or more files from a mass  storage  disk  volume  (see
     File).

  o  Delete  queue  characteristic  definitions  established  by   the
     DEFINE/CHARACTERISTIC command (see /CHARACTERISTIC).

  o  Delete one or more entries from a printer or batch job queue (see
     /ENTRY).

  o  Delete form definitions established by  the  DEFINE/FORM  command
     (see /FORM).

  o  Delete key definitions established by the DEFINE/KEY command (see
     /KEY).

  o  Delete a specific print or batch queue and all the jobs the queue
     contains (see /QUEUE).

  o  Delete symbol definitions from a local  or  global  symbol  table
     (see /SYMBOL).
2 File
  Deletes one or more files from a mass storage disk volume.

  Format:

    DELETE file-spec[,...]
3 Parameters

 file-spec[,...]

  Specifies the names of one or more files to be deleted from  a  mass
  storage  disk  volume.  The first file specification must contain an
  explicit or default directory specification plus a file name, a file
  type,  and  a  version  number;  subsequent file specifications must
  contain a version number.  You can use wildcard characters in any of
  the file specification fields.

  If you omit the directory specification or device name, the  current
  default device and directory are assumed.

  A semicolon followed by no file version number, by a version  number
  of  0,  or  by  one  or  more spaces in the version number of a file
  specification results in the deletion of the latest version  of  the
  file.

  To delete more than one file, separate the file specifications  with
  commas or plus signs.
3 Command_Qualifiers

/BACKUP

 /BACKUP

 Selects files according to the dates of  their  most  recent  backup.
  This qualifier is relevant only when used with the /BEFORE or /SINCE
  qualifier.  Use  of  the  /BACKUP  qualifier  is  incompatible  with
  /CREATED, /EXPIRED, and /MODIFIED.  /CREATED is the default.

/BEFORE

 /BEFORE[=time]

 Selects only those files that are dated before the specified time.

  You can specify either an absolute time or a combination of absolute
  and  delta  times.   See  Section 2.5 in the VAX/VMS DCL  Dictionary
  (or  access  the  HELP topic SPECIFY) for  complete  information  on
  specifying  time  values.   You  can  also  use the   keywords TODAY,
  TOMORROW, and YESTERDAY. If no time is  specified,  TODAY is assumed.

/BY_OWNER

 /BY_OWNER[=uic]

 Selects one or more files only if  their  owner  user  identification
  code (UIC) matches the specified owner UIC.

  Specify the UIC using standard UIC format as  described  in  Section
  3.7.1  in  the  VAX/VMS  DCL  Dictionary  (or access  the HELP topic
  SPECIFY).

  If the /BY_OWNER qualifier is specified without a UIC,  the  UIC  of
  the current process is assumed.

/CONFIRM

 /CONFIRM
 /NOCONFIRM

  Controls whether a request is issued before each  individual  DELETE
  operation  to confirm that the operation should be performed on that
  file.

  When the system  issues  the  prompt,  you  can  issue  any  of  the
  following responses:

       YES      NO     QUIT
       TRUE     FALSE  <CTRL/Z>
       1        0      ALL
                <RET>  

  You can use any combination of upper- and lowercase letters for word
  responses.  Word responses can be abbreviated to one or more letters
  (for example, T, TR, or TRU for TRUE).  Affirmative answers are YES,
  TRUE, and 1.  Negative answers are NO, FALSE, 0, and <RET>.  QUIT or
  CTRL/Z indicates that you want to stop  processing  the  command  at
  that  point.   When  you  respond with ALL, the command continues to
  process, but no further prompts are given.  If you type  a  response
  other than one of those in the list, the prompt will be reissued.

/CREATED

 /CREATED

 Selects files based on their dates of creation.   This  qualifier  is
  relevant  only  when used with the /BEFORE or /SINCE qualifier.  Use
  of the /CREATED qualifier is incompatible  with  /BACKUP,  /EXPIRED,
  and /MODIFIED.  /CREATED is the default.

/ERASE

 /ERASE
 /NOERASE

  When you simply delete a file, the area in which the file was stored
  is  returned to the system for future use.  The data that was stored
  in that location still exists  in  the  system  until  new  data  is
  written over it.  With the /ERASE qualifier, the storage location is
  overwritten with a system specified pattern  so  that  the  data  no
  longer  exists.   By  default,  no  erasing  is  done to the storage
  location when a file is deleted.

/EXCLUDE

 /EXCLUDE=(file-spec[,...])

 Any files that match the listed file  specification(s)  are  excluded
  from  the  DELETE  operation.  If you specify only one file, you can
  omit the parentheses.

  Wildcard characters are allowed in  the  file  specifications.   The
  file  specification can contain a directory specification.  However,
  you cannot include the  device  in  the  file  specification(s)  you
  supply with the /EXCLUDE qualifier.

/EXPIRED

 /EXPIRED

 Selects files according to the dates on which they will expire.  This
  qualifier  is  relevant  only  when  used with the /BEFORE or /SINCE
  qualifier.  Use of  the  /EXPIRED  qualifier  is  incompatible  with
  /BACKUP, /CREATED, and /MODIFIED.  /CREATED is the default.

/LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

  Controls whether the DELETE command displays the file  specification
  of each file after its deletion.

  By default, the DELETE command does not display the names  of  files
  after it deletes them.

/MODIFIED

 /MODIFIED

 Selects files  according  to  the  dates  on  which  they  were  last
  modified.   This  qualifier  is  relevant  only  when  used with the
  /BEFORE or /SINCE qualifier.  Use  of  the  /MODIFIED  qualifier  is
  incompatible  with /BACKUP, /CREATED, and /EXPIRED.  /CREATED is the
  default.

/SINCE

 /SINCE[=time]

 Selects only those files that are dated after the specified time.

  You can specify either an absolute time or a combination of absolute
  and  delta  times.   See  Section 2.5 in the VAX/VMS  DCL Dictionary
  (or  access  the  HELP topic SPECIFY) for  complete  information  on
  specifying  time  values.   You  can  also  use the  keywords  TODAY,
  TOMORROW, and YESTERDAY. If no time is  specified,  TODAY is assumed.

3 Examples

  1.   $ DELETE   COMMON.SUM;2

  The DELETE command deletes the file COMMON.SUM;2  from  the  current
  default disk and directory.

  2.   $ DELETE *.OLD;*

  The DELETE command deletes all versions of files with file type  OLD
  from the default disk directory.

  3.   $ DELETE/CONFIRM/SINCE=TODAY [MALCOLM.TESTFILES]*.OBJ;*

       DISK0:[MALCOLM.TESTFILES]AVERAG.OBJ;1, delete? [N]:Y
       DISK0:[MALCOLM.TESTFILES]SCANLINE.OBJ;4, delete? [N]:N
       DISK0:[MALCOLM.TESTFILES]SCANLINE.OBJ;3, delete? [N]:N
       DISK0:[MALCOLM.TESTFILES]SCANLINE.OBJ;2, delete? [N]:N
       DISK0:[MALCOLM.TESTFILES]WEATHER.OBJ;3, delete? [N]:Y

  The DELETE command examines all versions of files with file type OBJ
  in the subdirectory [MALCOLM.TESTFILES], and locates those that were
  created or modified today.  Before deleting each file,  it  requests
  confirmation   that   the  file  should  be  deleted.   The  default
  response---N---is given in square brackets.

  4.   $ DELETE DALLAS"THOMAS SECRET"::DISK0:[000,000]DECODE.LIS;1

  This DELETE command deletes the file DECODE.LIS;1 from the directory
  [000,000]  on device DISK0 at remote node DALLAS.  The user name and
  password follow the remote node name.
2 /CHARACTERISTIC
  Deletes the definition of a queue characteristic that was previously
  established    with    the   DEFINE/CHARACTERISTIC   command.    The
  /CHARACTERISTIC qualifier is required.

  Format:

    DELETE/CHARACTERISTIC characteristic-name
3 Parameters

 characteristic-name

  Specifies the name that was assigned  to  the  characteristic  by  a
  DEFINE/CHARACTERISTIC command.
2 /ENTRY
  Deletes one or more job entries from a queue.  The /ENTRY  qualifier
  is required.

  Format:

    DELETE/ENTRY=(entry-number[,...]) queue-name[:]
3 Parameters

 entry-number[,...]

  Specifies the entry number of the job to be deleted from the  queue.
  The  /ENTRY  qualifier requires at least one entry-number parameter.
  The parameter specifies the entry number(s) of one or more  jobs  to
  be  deleted  from  a  single printer or batch queue.  If you specify
  only one entry number, you can omit the parentheses.

 queue-name[:]

  Specifies the name of the queue where the job(s) are  located.   The
  queue  name  can  refer  either  to  the  queue to which the job was
  submitted or to the queue where the job is executing.

3 Examples

  1.   $ PRINT/HOLD   ALPHA.TXT
       Job ALPHA (queue SYS$PRINT, entry 110) holding
          .
          .
          .
       $ DELETE/ENTRY=110  SYS$PRINT

  The PRINT command queues a copy of the  file  ALPHA.TXT  in  a  HOLD
  status,  to defer its printing until later.  The system displays the
  job name, entry number, name of the  queue  in  which  the  job  was
  entered,  and  the status.  Later, the DELETE/ENTRY command requests
  that the entry be deleted from the queue SYS$PRINT.

  2.   $ PRINT CHAPTER8.MEM
         Job CHAPTER8 (queue SYS$PRINT, entry 25) pending on queue
       LPA0
          .
          .
          .
       $ SHOW QUEUE SYS$PRINT
       Printer queue SYS$PRINT, on LPA0:

       Jobname         Username        Entry   Blocks  Status
       -------         --------        -----   ------  ------
       CHAPTER7        SMITH              24      274  Pending
       CHAPTER8        SMITH              25      976  Pending

       $ DELETE/ENTRY=25 SYS$PRINT

  The PRINT command submits  the  file  CHAPTER8.MEM  to  the  generic
  printer  queue  SYS$PRINT.  Later, user Smith finds he needs to edit
  the file again before printing it.  Using the SHOW QUEUE command, he
  verifies that the job is still pending and that the entry number for
  the job is 25.  Then he issues the DELETE/ENTRY  command  to  delete
  the job from the queue.
2 /FORM
  Deletes the definition of a form type for printer or terminal queues
  that  was  previously established with the DEFINE/FORM command.  The
  /FORM qualifier is required.

  Format:

    DELETE/FORM form-name
3 Parameters

 form-name

  Specifies the name that was assigned to the form  by  a  DEFINE/FORM
  command.
2 /KEY
  Deletes key definitions that have been established by the DEFINE/KEY
  command.  The /KEY qualifier is required.

  Format:

    DELETE/KEY [key-name]
3 Parameters

 key-name

  Specifies the name of the key whose definition you want to delete.
3 Command_Qualifiers

/ALL

 /ALL

 Specifies that all key definitions in the specified state be deleted.
  If  you  use  the  /ALL qualifier, do not specify a key name.  If no
  state is specified, all key definitions in  the  current  state  are
  deleted.  Use the /STATE qualifier to specify one or more states.

/LOG

 /LOG
 /NOLOG

  Controls  whether  messages  are  displayed  indicating   that   the
  specified  key  definitions  have  been  deleted.   The messages are
  displayed by default.

/STATE

 /STATE=(state-name[,...])
 /NOSTATE

  Specifies the name(s)  of  state(s)  for  which  the  specified  key
  definition(s)  are  to  be  deleted.   If you specify only one state
  name, you  can  omit  the  parentheses.   State  names  can  be  any
  appropriate alphanumeric string.

  If you omit the /STATE qualifier or use /NOSTATE, key definitions in
  the current state are deleted.

3 Examples

  1.   $ DEFINE/KEY PF3 "SHOW TIME" /TERMINATE
       %DCL-I-DEFKEY, DEFAULT key PF3 has been defined
       (<PF3>)
       $ SHOW TIME
        15-APR-1984 14:43:59 
          .
          .
          .
       $ DELETE/KEY PF3
       %/DCL-I-DELKEY, DEFAULT key PF3 has been deleted
       (<PF3>)
       $



  The DEFINE/KEY command defines the PF3 key on the keypad to  perform
  the  SHOW  TIME  command.   Later, you use the DELETE/KEY command so
  that the PF3 key no longer has a definition.   Now  when  you  press
  that key, only the system prompt appears.

  2.   $ DELETE/KEY/ALL
       %DCL-I-DELKEY, DEFAULT key PF1 has been deleted
       %DCL-I-DELKEY, DEFAULT key PF2 has been deleted
       %DCL-I-DELKEY, DEFAULT key PF3 has been deleted
       %DCL-I-DELKEY, DEFAULT key PF4 has been deleted
       $



  This example assumes that you had defined keys PF1  through  PF4  in
  the   default   state.   The  DELETE/KEY  command  deletes  all  key
  definitions in the current state, which is the default state.
2 /QUEUE
  Deletes the specified queue.  The /QUEUE qualifier is required.

  Format:

    DELETE/QUEUE queue-name[:]
3 Parameters

 queue-name[:]

  Specifies the name of the queue to be deleted.

3 Examples

  1.   $ INITIALIZE/QUEUE/DEFAULT=FLAG/START LPA0
          .
          .
          .
       $ STOP/QUEUE/NEXT LPA0
       $ DELETE/QUEUE LPA0



  The first command initializes and starts  the  printer  queue  LPA0.
  Later,  when  you  decide to delete that queue, first stop the queue
  with the STOP/QUEUE/NEXT command.  Then delete the queue by  issuing
  the DELETE/QUEUE command.
2 /SYMBOL
  Deletes a symbol definition from a local or global symbol  table  or
  deletes  all  symbol  definitions  in  a  symbol table.  The /SYMBOL
  qualifier is required.

  Format:

    DELETE/SYMBOL [symbol-name]
3 Parameters

 symbol-name

  Specifies the name of the symbol to be deleted.   Symbol  names  can
  have  from  1  to  255  characters.   By  default, the DELETE/SYMBOL
  command assumes that the symbol is in the local symbol table for the
  current command procedure.

  The symbol-name parameter is required unless /ALL is specified.
3 Command_Qualifiers

/ALL

 /ALL

 Specifies that all symbol names in  the  specified  symbol  table  be
  deleted.   If  you  do  not  specify  either  /LOCAL or /GLOBAL, all
  symbols defined at the current command level are deleted.

/GLOBAL

 /GLOBAL

 Indicates that the symbol name is  to  be  deleted  from  the  global
  symbol table of the current process.

/LOCAL

 /LOCAL

 Indicates that the symbol name is to be deleted from the local symbol
  table of the current command level.  The default is /LOCAL.

/LOG

 /LOG

 Indicates that an informational message, listing the symbol(s)  being
  deleted,  be  displayed.   By default, no informational messages are
  displayed.

3 Examples

  1.   $ DELETE/SYMBOL/ALL

  The DELETE/SYMBOL command deletes  all  symbol  definitions  at  the
  current command level.

  2.   $ DELETE/SYMBOL/LOG FOO
       %DCL-I-DELSYM, LOCAL symbol FOO has been deleted

  The DELETE/SYMBOL command deletes the  symbol  FOO  from  the  local
  symbol  table  for  the  current  process.   In  addition,  the /LOG
  qualifier causes an informational message, listing the symbol  being
  deleted, to be displayed.

  3.   $ DELETE/SYMBOL/GLOBAL PDEL

  The DELETE/SYMBOL command deletes the symbol  named  PDEL  from  the
  global symbol table for the current process.
