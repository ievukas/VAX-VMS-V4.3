! LIB2RTLVC.DAT - data file used by VECTORTST.COM for LIBRTL2.EXE
!
!	This file contains the master list of all universal symbols
!	in the shared LIBRTL vector, along with their vector addresses.
!	It is used by VECTORTST.COM to determine whether or not
!	any vectors have moved.  Any newly shared symbol must be
!	added to this list.
!
!	The syntax is:
!	   symbol-hex_address
!	where:
!	   symbol is the global symbol in the vector
!	   hex_address is the address of the vector in hex; all 8
!	     digits must be given
!
!	A line beginning with a ! is a comment and is ignored.
!	The symbol must begin in column 1.  There must be no extra
!	characters (i.e. spaces) in the lines.
!
!	If a universal symbol is not vectored (e.g. a patch area)
!	its address is represented with an asterisk (*).

!	*************************************************************
!
!	If you move or delete a vector address, MAKE SURE THAT YOU
!	KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!  In particular, symbols present
!	in released software MUST NOT BE MOVED!  It is a bad idea
!	to move even unreleased symbols.  
!
!	The symbols MUST be in alphabetical order!!!!!!!
