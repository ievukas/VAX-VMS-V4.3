;
; ABSTRACT:
;		This module contains miscellaneous definitions used throughout 
;		NETACP.
;
; AUTHOR:	Alan D. Eldridge, CREATION DATE: 13-APR-1979
;
; MODIFIED BY:
;
;	V011	RNG0011		Rod Gamache		18-Jun-1984
;		Add NET$V_LOGDBR flag to NET$GL_FLAGS that indicates a data
;		base entry needs to have counters logged.
;
;	V010	RNG0010		Rod Gamache		23-Feb-1984
;		Add constants for ACP activity timer and AQB work
;		queue entry count.
;
;	V009	TMH0009		Tim Halvorsen		18-Mar-1983
;		Increase maximum size of route header by 7 to allow for
;		Routing Layer padding.
;
;	V008	TMH0008		Tim Halvorsen		14-Feb-1983
;		Increase maximum size of route header by 1.
;
;	V007	TMH0007		Tim Halvorsen		01-Dec-1982
;		Increase symbol which defines the maximum size of a
;		transport header, since Phase IV transport headers are
;		now larger.
;		Remove several unused symbols.
;
;	V006	TMH0006		Tim Halvorsen		13-Oct-1982
;		Add symbols for area routing support.
;
;	V005	TMH0005		Tim Halvorsen		01-Jul-1982
;		Add Phase IV routing constants.
;		Increase maximum number of nodes to 1024 for Phase IV,
;		which increases the size of the NDI vector, CHM, MIN_C_H.
;
;	V004	TMH0004		Tim Halvorsen		25-Mar-1982
;		Remove obsolete and unreferenced symbols NET$C_MAXCNFSIZ,
;		TR$C_PH2_RTHDR and CNF$C_TYPE.
;
;	V02-03	ADE0003		A.Eldridge		31-Dec-1981
;		Delete the obsolete TR$_REQXMT and TR$_CANCEL function codes.
;
;	V02-02	ADE0002		A.Eldridge		31-Dec-1981
;		Increased VMS limit on the maximum object name from 8 to 12.
;
;	V02-01	ADE0001		A.Eldridge		20-Dec-1981
;		Updated the $NETSYMDEF macro to include NET$V_TIMER.
