! This file contains the definitions necessary to set up the keypad
! recognition for the ACL editor.  The basic form for a key definition is:
!
!		DEFINE action AS characters OR characters OR ...
!
! where 'action' is a keyword to describe the desired action and 'characters'
! is a list of characters that must be entered to invoke the desired action.
! The list of characters must either be a character string preceeded by the
! keyword "escape" or a single character preceeded by the keyword "control".
! In addition, the keyword "gold" may also appear to indicate that striking
! the defined gold key must preceed the list of characters entered to invoke
! the desired action.  A character string is defined as a series of characters
! within angle bracket (<>) delimiters.  Within the character string case is
! preserved.
!
! For example:
!
! To define the ACE entering action as being a control-A character, the
! following definition must appear:
!
!	define enter_ace as control,A
!
! it may also appear as
!
!	define enter_ace as control,<A>
!
! To define the ACE entering action as being the ENTER key on the keypad,
! the following definition must appear:
!
!	define enter_ace as escape,<OM>
!
