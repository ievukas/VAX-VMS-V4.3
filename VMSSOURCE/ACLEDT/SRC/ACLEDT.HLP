1 STARTING_UP
Novice users of the ACL Editor will be primarily concerned with a portion
of the available functions.  Below is a simple scenario to add an ACE to
the file's ACL:

    1)	If not already at the "(IDENTIFIER=" prompt, use the INSERT key
	to indicate you wish to add an ACE (you will then get the prompt).
    2)	Enter the UIC (and any identifiers such as BATCH, REMOTE, etc) that
	will identify to whom the ACE applies (or use the ITEM key to select
	a different ACE type).
    3)	Use the FIELD key to advance to the next portion of the ACE.
    4)	Use the ITEM key to select the desired option or access.
    5)	Repeat 3 and 4 until all options and access modes have been selected.
    6)	Use the ENTER key to indicate the you are satisfied with the ACE,
	and that it should be added to the file's ACL.
    7)	If the ACE is not entered because of a syntax error, use the arrow
	keys to postion to the portion of the ACE causing the error.  Correct
	the error, and again press the ENTER key to add the ACE.
    8)	Repeat 2 through 7 until all ACEs have been added.  Then type
	Control-Z to finish the editing session, and return to DCL.

Press the return key to return to the keypad diagram.
