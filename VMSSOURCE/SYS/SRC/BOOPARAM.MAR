; FACILITY:	System bootstrapping and initialization
;
; ABSTRACT:	Define interface between SYSBOOT and INIT for passing
;		bootstrap parameters.
;
; ENVIRONMENT:	This module is linked against SYSBOOT and against INIT; it
;		shares both of their environments.

; This module reserves storage for bootstrap parameters to be passed from
; SYSBOOT to INIT.  In many ways, this module functions like SYSPARAM does:
;	- It is linked both into SYSBOOT.EXE and SYS.EXE.
;	- SYSBOOT fills in its copy of this module with derived values, then
;	  copies this "parameter block" into the reserved space linked into
;	  INIT.
; This module differs from SYSPARAM in that SYSPARAM parameters stay in the
; system after INIT has deleted itself;  BOOPARAM paramters are used only by
; INIT and are deleted along with INIT.
;--

;
; Put the data in a psect contiguous to INIT's Z$INIT000 psect, so INIT can
; define a symbol unique to SYS.EXE for the base of this module.
