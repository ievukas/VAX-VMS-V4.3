 of the name is allocated (for example, DU means any disk device). If
 more than one device is specified, the first available device is
 allocated.
logical-name
 A character string of 1 through 255 characters. Enclose the string in
 quotation marks (") if it contains blanks. Trailing colons are not

 Requires the Program Development Tools Option.
3 Parameter
dump-file
 The image dump file to be analyzed.
3 Qualifiers
/FULL
 Displays all known information about the failing process.
/IMAGE[=image-name]
 /NOIMAGE
 Specifies the image whose symbols are used in analyzing the 
 dump.  The /NOIMAGE qualifier uses no symbols.  By default, the 
 symbols from the image with the same name as the image that was 
 running at the time of the dump are used.
/INTERACTIVE
 /NOINTERACTIVE (default)
 Pauses the display of information on your terminal screen when it 
 is full; type RETURN to display additional information.
/MISCELLANEOUS
 Displays all the miscellaneous information in the dump.
/OUTPUT[=file-spec]
 Writes the information to the specified file or, by default, 
 to SYS$OUTPUT.
/RELOCATION
 Displays the addresses to which data structures saved in the dump 
 are mapped.

2 /RMS_FILE
Examines the internal structure of a VAX/VMS RMS file.  The 
qualifiers /CHECK, /FDL, /INTERACTIVE, /STATISTICS, and /SUMMARY 
perform mutually exclusive functions.

Format
 ANALYZE/RMS_FILE file-spec[,...]

 Requires the Program Development Tools Option.

3 Parameter
file-spec
 Specification of the file(s) to be analyzed.  The default file 
 type is DAT.  Multiple file specifications and wildcard characters 
 are allowed unless you specify /FDL or /INTERACTIVE.
3 Qualifiers
/CHECK (default)
 Examines the specified file's integrity and structure, writing 
 the report of any errors in the file's structure to SYS$OUTPUT 
 by default.  To suppress the report or write it to a file, use 
 the /OUTPUT qualifier.
/FDL
 Examines the specified file's structure, generating an FDL 
 (File Definition Language) file that describes the file.  The FDL 
 file by default has the same file name as the input file
 and a file type of FDL.  To assign a different file specification, 
 use the /OUTPUT qualifier.  Multiple file specifications and 
 wildcard characters are not allowed with /FDL.
/INTERACTIVE
 Examines the specified file's structure interactively.  Multiple 
 file specifications and wildcard characters are not allowed.  An 
 interactive session begins at the file header.  The next level 
 down is the file attribute level.  Levels below the file attribute 
 level are determined by the type of file.  Each data structure in 
 the file is referred to as a node.  The interactive subcommands 
 are:

 AGAIN          Displays the current structure again.
 DOWN [branch]  Displays the name at the next level. If the current 
                node has more than one branch, you must specify a 
                branch value.  For a list of possible branch values, 
                specify branch as a question mark.)
 DUMP number    Displays a hexadecimal dump of the specified virtual
                block.)
 EXIT           Terminates the interactive session.
 FIRST          Displays the first node of the current level.
 HELP [command] Displays information about the subcommands.
 NEXT           Displays the next node of the current level.
                Pressing RETURN issues the NEXT subcommand.
 REST           Displays the remaining nodes of the current level.
 TOP            Displays the file header.
 UP             Displays the node at the previous level.
/OUTPUT=file-spec
 /NOOUTPUT
 Specifies the output file to which the results of the file analysis 
 are to be sent.  When /INTERACTIVE is also specified, a transcript 
 of the interactive session is written to the output file.  The 
 default file specification of the output file is ANALYZE.ANL, unless 
 /FDL is specified, in which case the output file has a default file 
 name that is the same as the input file name and a default file type 
 of FDL.  The /NOOUTPUT qualifier produces no output unless specified 
 with the /CHECK qualifier, in which case the message telling whether 
 or not the file has errors is displayed.
/STATISTICS
 Examines the specified file's integrity and structure, writing the 
 report to SYS$OUTPUT by default.  To write the report to a file, use 
 the /OUTPUT qualifier.
/SUMMARY
 Examines the specified file, writing a summary report (without 
 statistics) about the file's structure to SYS$OUTPUT by default.  To 
 write the report to a file, use the /OUTPUT qualifier.

 /NOCONTIGOUS
 Qualifies output-file-spec.
 Specifies that the output file must occupy physically contiguous disk
 blocks. By default, the APPEND command creates an output file in the
 same format as the corresponding input file and does not report an
 error if not enough space exists for a contiguous allocation.
/CREATED
 See /BACKUP.
/EXCLUDE=(file-spec,...)
 Omits the specified file(s) from the append operation. You can include
 a directory but not a device in the file specification(s). Wildcard
 characters are allowed.
/EXPIRED
 See /BACKUP.
/EXTENSION=n
 Qualifies output-file-spec.
 Sets the default extend quantity for the output file. Relevant only
 with the /NEW_VERSION qualifier.
/LOG
 /NOLOG (default)
 Displays file specifications of input and output files as well as the
 number of blocks or records appended after each append operation.
 Displays the number of new files created after the entire append
 operation.
/MODIFIED
 See /BACKUP.
/NEW_VERSION
 /NONEW_VERSION (default)
 Qualifies output-file-spec.
 Creates a new output file if the specified output file does not exist.
 If the output file does exist, the /NEW_VERSION qualifier appends the
 input file to the output file.
/PROTECTION=(ownership[:access],...)
 Qualifies output-file-spec.
 Specifies protection for the output file. Specify ownership as SYSTEM,
 OWNER, GROUP, or WORLD and access as R, W, E, or D. The default
 protection is that of the existing output file; if no output file
 exists, the current default protection applies.
/READ_CHECK
 /NOREAD_CHECK (default)
 Qualifies input-file-spec.
 Reads each record in the input file(s) twice to verify that it has
 been read correctly.
/SINCE[=time]
 Selects for the append operation only those files dated (creation,
 modification, expiration, or backup) after the specified time. You can
 specify time as an absolute time, a combination of absolute and delta
 times, or as one of the following keywords: TODAY (default), TOMORROW,
 YESTERDAY.
/WRITE_CHECK
 /NOWRITE_CHECK (default)
 Qualifies output-file-spec.
 Reads each record in the output file(s) after the record is written to
 verify that it is written correctly.
1 Ascii
 To calculate the hexadecimal value of a character, use the column position 
 of the character as the 16's position, and the row position as the units
 position.  For example, an uppercase A has a hexadecimal value of 41.

1 ASSIGN
Associates equivalence names with a logical name. If you specify an
existing logical name, the new equivalence names replace the existing
equivalence names.
 
Format
 ASSIGN equivalence-name,... logical-name
2 Parameters
equivalence-name
 A character string of 1 to 255 characters. If the string contains
 other than upper case alphanumeric, dollar sign, or underscore
 characters, enclose it in quotation marks ("). Use double quotation
 marks ("") to denote an actual quotation mark. Specifying more than
 one equivalence name for a logical name creates a search list.
logical-name
 A character string of 1 through 255 characters. If the string contains
 other than upper case alphanumeric, dollar sign, or underscore
 characters, enclose it in quotation marks ("). Use double quotation
 marks ("") to denote an actual quotation mark. If you terminate
 logical-name with a colon, the system removes the colon. If the
 logical name is to be entered into the process or system directory
 logical name tables, then the name may only have from 1 to 31
 alphanumeric characters (including the dollar sign and underscore).
2 Qualifiers
/EXECUTIVE_MODE
 /SUPERVISOR_MODE (default)
 /USER_MODE
 Executive mode requires SYSNAM privilege.
 Specifies the mode of the logical name. If you specify executive mode,
 but do not have SYSNAM privilege, a supervisor mode logical name is
 created. The mode of the logical name must be the same as or external
 to (less privileged than) the mode of the table in which you are
 placing the name. If you specify a user mode logical name in the
 process logical name table, that logical name is used for the
 execution of a single image only; user mode entries are deleted from
 the logical name table when any image executing in the process exits
 (that is, after any DCL command or user program that executes an
 image) completes execution.
/GROUP
 /JOB
 /PROCESS (default)
 /SYSTEM
 Group logical names require SYSPRV or GRPNAM privilege.
 System logical names require SYSNAM or SYSPRV privilege.
 Specifies the table in which the logical name is to be placed. The
 /GROUP qualifier is synonymous with /TABLE=LNM$GROUP. The /JOB
 qualifier is synonymous with /TABLE=LNM$JOB. The /PROCESS qualifier is
 synonymous with /TABLE=LNM$PROCESS. The /SYSTEM qualifier is
 synonymous with /TABLE=LNM$SYSTEM.
/LOG (default)
 /NOLOG
 Displays a message when a new logical name supersedes an existing
 name.
/NAME_ATTRIBUTES[=(keyword,...)]
 Specifies the attributes for a logical name. (By default, no
 attributes are set. You can specify the following keywords for
 attributes:
 
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | CONFINE  | Does not copy the logical name into a spawned |
 |          | subprocess. Relevant  only for logical names  |
 |          | in a private table.                           |
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | NO_ALIAS | Prohibits creation of logical names with the  |
 |          | same name in an outer (less privileged) access|
 |          | mode within the specified table.  Deletes any |
 |          | previously created, identical names in an     |
 |          | outer access mode within the specified table. |
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 
/PROCESS
 See /GROUP.
/SUPERVISOR_MODE
 See /EXECUTIVE_MODE.
/SYSTEM
 See /GROUP.
/TABLE=name
 Requires WRITE access to the table if the table is shareable.
 Specifies the name of the logical name table in which the logical name
 is to be entered. You can specify user-defined tables (created with
 the CREATE/NAME_TABLE command), the process, group, job, or system
 logical name table, or the process or system logical name directory
 table. The default is LNM$PROCESS. If you specify a table name that
 translates to more than one table, the logical name is placed in the
 first table found.
/TRANSLATION_ATTRIBUTES[=keyword,...]
 Qualifies each equivalence-name.
 Specifies attributes of the equivalence-name. Possible keywords
 are:
 
 +-----------+----------------------------------------------+
 | CONCEALED | Indicates that the equivalence string is the |
 |           | name  of a concealed device.                 |
 +-----------+----------------------------------------------+
 | TERMINAL  | Terminates logical name translation after    |
 |           | iterative translation of this equivalence    |
 |           | string.
 +-----------+----------------------------------------------+
 
/USER_MODE
 See /EXECUTIVE_MODE.

2 Qualifiers
/BACKUP
 /CREATED
 /EXPIRED
 /MODIFIED (default)
 Qualifies input files.
 Selects files for the backup operation according to the dates of their
 most recent backups, their creation dates, their expiration dates, or
 the dates of their last modifications. Relevant only with the /BEFORE
 and /SINCE qualifiers.

 +-----------+----------------------------------------------+
 
/BLOCK_SIZE=number-of-bytes
 Qualifies output save sets.
 Specifies the output block size in bytes. The minimum is 2048 bytes;
 the maximum is 65535 bytes; the default is 32256 bytes.
/BRIEF (default)
 /FULL
 Lists a brief amount of information on each file saved or restored
 (specification, size, and creation date), or lists the information in
 the format of the DIRECTORY /FULL command. Relevant only when the
 /LIST qualifier is also specified.
/BUFFER_COUNT=number-of-buffers
 Specifies the number of I/O buffers to be used in the backup
 operation. The maximum value is 5; the default is 3.
/COMMENT=string
 Qualifies output save sets.
 Places the comment in the save set. The comment is displayed in list
 operations. If the comment contains spaces or special characters,
 enclose it in quotation marks (").
/COMPARE
 Compares two files, two groups of files, or a save set and a file or
 group of files. In the latter case, the save set must be specified as
 the first parameter. The default version number is *, which processes
 all versions of the file.
/CONFIRM
 Qualifies input files.
 For each file being copied or saved, displays a query to which you
 must respond Y to copy the file -- any other response skips the copy
 or save operation for that file.
/CRC (default)
 /NOCRC
 Qualifies input and output save sets.
 Performs the Cyclic Redundancy Check on save set data.
/CREATED
 See /BACKUP.
/DELETE
 Deletes input files after they are saved.
/EXCLUDE=(file-spec,...)
 Qualifies input files.
 Excludes the specified files from the copy or save operation. Wildcard
 characters are allowed. No device names are allowed.
/EXPIRED
 See /BACKUP.
/FAST
 Requires write access to [0,0]INDEX.SYS on the volume containing the
 files being saved, or the volume must be write locked.
 Uses a fast file scan. The /FAST qualifier is ignored if used with the
 /IMAGE qualifier.
/FULL

/GROUP_SIZE=number-of-blocks
 Qualifies output save sets.
 Defines the number of blocks to be placed in each redundancy group.
 Using the redundant information, 1 "uncorrectable" read error in
 each redundancy group can be corrected. The value must be from 0
 through 100; the default is 10; 0 means no redundancy blocks are
 written.
/IGNORE=keyword
 Overrides restrictions placed on files. Possible keywords are:
 
 +-----------+----------------------------------------------+
 | INTERLOCK | Processes files that otherwise could not be  |
 |           | processed because of  file access            |
 |           | conflicts, specifically files currently      |
 |           | open for writing.   Requires SYSPRV          |
 |           | privilege.                                   |
 +-----------+----------------------------------------------+
 | NOBACKUP  | Saves or copies the contents of files that   |
 |           | are marked with the  /NOBACKUP qualifier of  |
 |           | the SET FILE command.                        |
 +-----------+----------------------------------------------+
 
/IMAGE
 Requires write access to [0,0]INDEXF.SYS and [0,0]BITMAP.SYS on the
 volume being processed, or the volume must be write locked.
 Copies, saves, or restores an entire volume. The output volume must be
 mounted /FOREIGN. The file specification parameters must consist only
 of the disk names. In save and copy operations, other file
 specification qualifiers are not allowed.
/INCREMENTAL
 Restores an incremental save set to a disk volume. The output file
 specification must consist only of the device name. The /INCREMENTAL
 qualifier assumes /OWNER_UIC=ORIGINAL, and can be used only on
 Files-11 Structure Level 2 volumes.
/INITIALIZE (default for /IMAGE)
 /NOINITIALIZE (default for sequential disk volumes)
 Initializes the output volume (in an image copy or a save operation).
 An image copy operation uses the volume initialization data on the
 input volume. Any existing data on the volume is lost.
/INTERCHANGE
 Do not use except where explicitly instructed.
 Does not copy access control lists or directories not selected as
 files.
/JOURNAL[=file-spec]
 Maintains a record of save sets, times of creation, and contents. When
 /JOURNAL is specified during a save operation, information concerning
 the operation is appended to the specified file. A new file is created
 if the specified file does not exist. The file specification defaults
 to SYS$DISK:BACKUP.BJL. Used with /LIST, the /JOURNAL qualifier
 displays the contents of the journal. The /BEFORE and /SINCE
 qualifiers, when used with /JOURNAL /LIST, refer to the time at which
 the save set (not saved files) was created.
/LABEL=(label,...)
 Qualifies output file-specs.
 Specifies the volume label for a save set written on a sequential
 disk. The label can contain from 1 to 12 alphanumeric characters. By
 default, label is derived from the save-set name.
/LIST[=file-spec]
 Lists information on the contents of a save set. The listing is
 written to file-spec, which defaults to SYS$OUTPUT. This qualifier can
 stand alone, in which case the first and only parameter must be the
 name of the save set; or the qualifier can be part of a save or
 restore operation, in which case the listing reflects the status of
 the save set after completion of the operation. Do not use /LOG with
 /LIST when the output is directed to SYS$OUTPUT.
/LOG
 /NOLOG (default)
 Displays on SYS$OUTPUT the name of each file as it is processed.
/MODIFIED (default)
 See /BACKUP.
/NEW_VERSION
 Qualifies output file-spec.
 Creates a new version of a file if you attempt to restore or copy a
 file to a directory that has a file of the same name and version
 number. Files are processed in decreasing version number order and
 created in ascending order, so that version numbers are inverted.
 Results are unpredictable if /NEW_VERSION is used with /COMPARE or
 /VERIFY.
/OVERLAY
 Qualifies output files.
 Overlays the named existing file rather than allocating new space for
 the file.
/OWNER_UIC=[uic]
 Positional.
 Requires SYSPRV privilege or ownership of the UIC to specify
 with an output file or save set.
 As an input file qualifier -- Processes only files owned by the
 specified UIC. A specification of /OWNER_UIC without a value means
 your process UIC.
 
 As an output file qualifier -- Resets the ownership of the copied or
 restored file. You can specify a UIC or one of the following keywords:
 
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | DEFAULT  | Your process UIC.                             |
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | ORIGINAL | Existing UIC of the saved file.               |
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | PARENT   | The UIC of the directory under which the file |
 |          | is being restored.                            |
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 
 If no /OWNER_UIC is specified, then it is the same as specifying
 /OWNER_UIC=DEFAULT. A /OWNER_UIC specification without a value means
 ORIGINAL.
 
 As an output save set qualifier -- Specifies ownership of the save
 set. The default is your process UIC.
/PHYSICAL
 Ignores any file structure on the volume. Output disks must be the
 same type as input disks; output disks cannot have a bad block where
 input disks do not. A save set written using /PHYSICAL can only be
 read as a physical save set. Output disks must have been mounted
 /FOREIGN; input disks must have been mounted /FOREIGN or the user must
 have LOG_IO privilege. The file specification for a physical volume
 can contain only a device name. Note that this should only be used on
 input and output disks proven to have no bad blocks.
/PROTECTION[=(ownership[:access],...)
 Qualifies output save sets.
 Specifies protection for a save set. Specify ownership as SYSTEM,
 OWNER, GROUP, or WORLD. Specify access as R, W, E, or D. Default
 protection is that of the current process.
/RECORD
 Requires ownership of the file or SYSPRV privilege.
 Records in the file header the backup date for each file processed.
 Valid only for Files-11 Structure Level 2 volumes.
/REPLACE
 Qualifies output files.
 Deletes the existing output file and creates a new file if you attempt
 to restore or copy a file to a directory that has a file of the same
 name and version number.
/SAVE_SET
 Qualifies input and output save sets.
 Identifies the file specification as a save set, not a normal file.
 This qualifier is required for save sets on disk.
/SELECT=(file-spec,...)
 Qualifies input save sets.
 Restores only the specified files. Wildcard characters are allowed. No
 device names are allowed.
/SINCE=time
 Qualifies input files.
 Selects for the append operation only those files dated after the
 specified time. You can specify time as an absolute time or as one of
 the following keywords:
 
 +-----------+----------------------------------------------+
 | BACKUP    | The date recorded by a previous              |
 |           | BACKUP/RECORD.                               |
 +-----------+----------------------------------------------+
 | TODAY     | The current day at 0 hours.                  |
 +-----------+----------------------------------------------+
 | TOMORROW  | TODAY plus 24 hours.                         |
 +-----------+----------------------------------------------+
 | YESTERDAY | TODAY minus 24 hours.                        |
 +-----------+----------------------------------------------+
 
/TRUNCATE
 /NOTRUNCATE (default)
 Truncates a sequential output file at end of file when creating it
 during a copy or restore operation. By default, a copy or restore
 operation uses the allocation of the input file to determine the size
 of the output file.
/VERIFY
 Verifies data transfers. On file structured copy operations, /VERIFY
 compares each file after it has been copied. On physical copy
 operations, /VERIFY compares the volume after it has been copied. For
 save or restore operations, /VERIFY compares in a separate pass.
 Incompatible with the /NEW_VERSION qualifier.
/VOLUME=number-of-volume
 Processes a specific disk volume in a disk volume set. Valid only with
 the /IMAGE qualifier. The /VOLUME qualifier requires only n+1 drives
 (rather than 2*n); during a copy or save operation the entire set must
 be write-locked for consistent results. In save operations the save
 set contains the segments of the files located on the specified
 volume. The input volume set must be fully mounted. The save set can
 be restored only with the /VOLUME qualifier. In restore operations the
 output volume is a functionally equivalent copy of the selected
 relative volume. In restore operations the input save set must have
 been created using the /IMAGE qualifier. The input save set can be
 either an image save set of a full disk volume set, or a selected
 volume save set created with the /VOLUME qualifier. You cannot use the
 /NOINITIALIZE qualifier in a restore operation with the /VOLUME
 qualifier. In a selected volume compare operation between two disk
 volume sets, both volume sets must be fully mounted.
1 CANCEL
Cancels wake-up requests for a specified process that were scheduled
with either the RUN command or the $SCHDWK system service.
 
Format
 CANCEL [process-name]
 
 Requires ownership of the process, or the GROUP or WORLD privilege.
2 Parameters
process-name
 Name of the process. The specified process must have the same group
 number in its UIC as does the current (issuing) process. Defaults to
 the current process. Ignored if the /IDENTIFICATION qualifier is
 specified.
2 Qualifiers
/IDENTIFICATION=pid
 Identifies the process by its process identification (PID). You can
 omit leading zeros in the PID.
1 CLOSE
Closes a file opened with the OPEN command and deassigns the
associated logical name. (Files that are opened for reading or writing
at DCL command level stay open until explicitly closed with the CLOSE
command or until the process terminates.)
 
Format
 CLOSE logical-name[:]
2 Parameters
logical-name
 Logical name associated with the file.
2 Qualifiers
/ERROR=label
 Specifies a label in the command procedure to receive control if the
 CLOSE operation results in an error. Overrides any ON condition action
 specified and sets $STATUS to success.
/LOG (default)
 /NOLOG 
 Generates a warning message when you attempt to close a file that was
 not opened by DCL. If you specify the /ERROR qualifier, the /LOG
 qualifier has no effect.
1 Command_procedure
 A command procedure is a file containing one or more DCL commands.  To
 execute the commands in a command procedure, type an at sign (@) 
 followed by the name of the file containing the commands.  

 For more information, see HINTS Command_procedures.
1 CONNECT
Connects your physical terminal to a virtual terminal that is
connected to another process with your UIC. No other physical
terminals may be connected to the virtual terminal.
 
Format
 CONNECT virtual-terminal
 
 Requires that the virtual terminal
 feature for the system and for your terminal be enabled at SYSGEN time.
2 Parameters
virtual-terminal
 Name of the virtual terminal.
2 Qualifiers
/CONTINUE
 /NOCONTINUE (default)
 Continues execution of your previous process after the connection is
 established. Incompatible with the /LOGOUT qualifier.
/LOGOUT (default)
 /NOLOGOUT
 Logs out your previous process when the connection is established.
 Incompatible with the /CONTINUE qualifier.
1 CONTINUE
Resumes execution of an image or command procedure interrupted by
CTRL/Y or CTRL/C. You cannot resume execution of the image if you have
entered a command that executes another image or if you have invoked a
command procedure.
 
Format
 CONTINUE

1 CONVERT
Copies the records of one file to another file, changing the 
organization and format of the input file, if necessary, to conform 
to that of the output file; can be invoked interactively.  Does not 
translate carriage control information.  You can also use CONVERT to 
reformat a relative or indexed file by specifying the input and output 
files as the same file.  Note that when reformatting a relative or 
indexed file, CONVERT establishes new record's file addresses (RFAs), 
and eliminates deleted records and empty record cells.

Format
 CONVERT input-file-spec[,...] output-file-spec

 Requires the Program Development Tools Option.

2 Parameters
input-file-spec
 Specification of the file(s)to be converted.  You may specify up 
 to 10 input files; wildcard characters are not allowed.  Multiple 
 input files are concatenated into a single output file.
output-file-spec
 Specification of the file to which the converted records are to 
 be written.  The output file can be an existing file; if it already
 contains records, the converted records can be added to the end
 sequentially, or the records can be merged into their proper sequential
 order in an indexed file.  The file type of the output file defaults to
 that of the first input file.  Wildcard characters are not allowed.
2 Qualifiers
/APPEND
 /NOAPPEND (default)
 Appends the output records to an existing sequential file.  This 
 qualifier is ignored if the output file's organization is relative 
 or indexed.  /APPEND overrides /CREATE.
/CREATE (default)
 /NOCREATE
 Creates an output file.  If the output file is to have different
 characteristics from those of the input file, specify the /FDL 
 qualifier.
/EXCEPTIONS_FILE[=file-spec]
 /NOEXCEPTIONS_FILE (default)
 Generates a sequential file that contains a copy of any input records 
 that cause exceptions and are, therefore, not written to the output 
 file.  File type defaults to EXC.  If no file is specified, the 
 exception records are written to SYS$OUTPUT.
/EXIT
 /NOEXIT (default)
 Terminates the conversion if an exception record is encountered.
/FAST_LOAD (default)
 /NOFAST_LOAD
 Uses a fast-loading algorithm for index files.  /FAST_LOAD sorts both 
 the primary and the secondary keys and, therefore, requires a larger 
 amount of space for work files.  /NOFAST_LOAD sorts only the primary 
 keys.
/FDL=file-spec
 Specifies the FDL (File Definition Language) file to be used in 
 creating the output file.  The default file type for the FDL file is 
 FDL; the output file's specification overrides the FDL file 
 specification.
/FILL_BUCKETS
 /NOFILL_BUCKETS (default)
 Overrides the bucket fill percentage parameter associated with the 
 output file, filling the buckets with as many records as possible.  
 This qualifier is only valid for indexed output files.
/FIXED_CONTROL
 /NOFIXED_CONTROL (default)
 Controls the behavior of CONVERT in conversions between VFC (VARIABLE 
 with FIXED CONTROL) records and other type records (FIXED or VARIABLE).  
 Not applicable to indexed files.

 o  If you specify /FIXED_CONTROL for VFC input records, the fixed
    control portion of the record will be written as the first part
    of the output record.
 o  If you specify /NOFIXED_CONTROL with VFC input records, the 
    fixed portion of the record is not copied to the output record.
 o  If you specify /FIXED_CONTROL for VFC output records, the fixed
    control portion of the output record is taken from the first
    part of the input record.
 o  If you specify /NOFIXED_CONTROL for VFC output records, the
    fixed portion of the output record is set to 0.

 Note that you must account for the size of the fixed control area 
 when calculating the maximum size of the output record.
/KEY[=n]
 Specifies the key of reference by which records are accessed from 
 an indexed file; valid only for indexed input files.  If you 
 specify an indexed output file, you must also specify /NOFAST and 
 /NOSORT.  The default is /KEY=0 (the primary key).
/MERGE
 Specifies that records are to be inserted into their proper 
 positions in an existing indexed file; valid only for existing 
 indexed output files.  /MERGE overrides /CREATE.  Omit /MERGE when 
 loading records into an empty indexed file or when creating a new 
 indexed file.
/PAD[=[radix]character]
 /NOPAD (default)
 Pads records that do not contain as many bytes as the record
 length for fixed-length record format with the specified character; 
 valid only for fixed-length record formats.  The character can be 
 any ASCII character A through Z, a through z, or 0 through 9; the 
 default is null.  To specify a nonprintable ASCII character, you 
 must specify a radix (%D for decimal, %O for octal, %X for 
 hexadecimal) and a numeric character; do not specify a radix with 
 a printable ASCII character.  The default, /NOPAD, causes an
 exception when a short record is encountered.
/PROLOG=n
 Specifies the prolog version number of the indexed output 
 file.  If you specify a value of 2, the output file will be 
 either a prolog 1 or prolog 2 file.  If you specify 3, CONVERT 
 will attempt to create a Prolog 3 file for output.  If the 
 output file cannot fit the criteria for Prolog 3, you will receive 
 a fatal error and the conversion will not occur.  If you do not 
 specify /PROLOG, CONVERT uses the VAX/VMS RMS default; specify the 
 SHOW RMS_DEFAULT command to display the default.  /PROLOG 
 overrides the value specified as the FDL attribute KEY PROLOG.
/READ_CHECK
 /NOREAD_CHECK (default)
 Reads each input record a second time and compares it to the 
 original.
/SHARE
 /NOSHARE (default)
 Opens the input file for sharing with other processes.  (Because 
 other processes can alter the records while CONVERT is operating, 
 the consistency of the output data file cannot be guaranteed.)
/SORT
 /NOSORT
 Sorts the input file before loading it into an indexed file;
 valid only with an indexed output file.  The sort is performed 
 on the primary key of the output file.  The default is /SORT, 
 unless you specified the same file for both input and output, 
 in which case it is /NOSORT.
/STATISTICS
 /NOSTATISTICS (default)
 Displays conversion statistics.
/TRUNCATE
 /NOTRUNCATE (default)
 Truncates records that exceed the maximum record length of
 the file or the record length for fixed record format.  
 /NOTRUNCATE prevents long records from being written to the output 
 file; /EXCEPTION_FILE writes the untruncated record to the 
 exception file.
/WORK_FILES=n
 Specifies the number of temporary work files to be used during 
 the sort process.  The value of n can be 0 or any value between 2 
 and 10.  The default for n is 2, and a value of 0 
 means that no work files are necessary because of sufficient
 physical memory.  Valid only with the /SORT or /FAST_LOAD 
 qualifiers.
/WRITE_CHECK
 /NOWRITE_CHECK (default)
 Reads each output record and compares it to the original.

2 /RECLAIM
Makes empty buckets in Prolog 3 indexed files available so 
that new records can be written in them.  If all the records in 
a bucket have been deleted, that bucket is locked until 
CONVERT/RECLAIM makes it available.  Unlike CONVERT, 
CONVERT/RECLAIM maintains record's file addresses (RFAs).

Format
 CONVERT/RECLAIM file-spec

 Requires the Program Development Tools Option.

3 Parameter
file-spec
 Specification of the Prolog 3 indexed file in which you want to
 reclaim buckets.  (This file cannot be opened for shared access 
 during bucket reclamation.)
3 Qualifiers
/STATISTICS
 /NOSTATISTICS (default)
 Displays conversion statistics.

1 COPY

device or directory is not specified, your current default device and
directory are used.
 
Format
 COPY input-file-spec,... output-file-spec
2 Parameters
input-file-spec
 Specification(s) of existing file(s) to be copied. Wildcard characters
 are allowed. Use a plus sign or a comma to concatenate multiple file
 specifications. If the input file is a directory file, a new empty
 directory is created as a subdirectory of the named directory.
output-file-spec
 Name of the resultant output file(s). Wildcard characters can be used
 in place of the directory name, file name, file type, and/or version
 number to generate multiple output files. You must specify at least
 one field in the output file specification. The output file has the
 UIC of the current process.
2 Qualifiers
/ALLOCATION=number-of-blocks
 Qualifies output-file-spec.
 Forces the initial allocation of the output file to the specified
 number of 512-byte blocks. If you do not specify the /ALLOCATION
 qualifier, the initial allocation of the output file is determined by
 the size of the input file.
/BACKUP
 /CREATED (default)
 /EXPIRED
 /MODIFIED
 Selects files for the copy operation according to the dates of their
 most recent backups, their creation dates, their expiration dates, or
 the dates of their last modifications. Relevant only with the /BEFORE
 and /SINCE qualifiers.
/BEFORE[=time]
 Selects for the copy operation only those files with dates (creation,
 modification, expiration, or backup) that precede the specified time.
 You can specify time as an absolute time, as a combination of absolute
 and delta times, or as one of the following keywords: TODAY (default),
 TOMORROW, YESTERDAY.
/BY_OWNER[=uic]
 Selects for the copy operation only those files with the specified
 user identification code. The default user identification code is that
 of the current process.
/CONCATENATE (default)
 /NOCONCATENATE
 Creates one output file from multiple input files when wildcard
 characters are not used in the output-file-spec. A specification of
 /NOCONCATENATE generates multiple output files. Files from Files-11
 Structure Level 2 disks are concatenated in alphanumeric order; if you
 specify a wild card in the file version field, files are copied in
 descending order by version number. Files from Files-11 Structure
 Level 1 disks are concatenated in random order.
/CONFIRM
 /NOCONFIRM (default)
 Issues a request for confirmation before each copy operation. The
 following responses are valid:
 
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | YES      | Perform the copy operation.                   |
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | NO       | Do not perform the copy operation.            |
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | TRUE     | Perform the copy operation.                   |
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | FALSE    | Do not perform the copy operation.            |

 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | 0        | Do not perform the copy operation.            |
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | <RETURN> | Perform the copy operation.                   |
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | ALL      | Continue execution of the command with no     |
 |          | further confirmation prompts.                 |
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | <CTRL/Z> | Stop execution of the command.                |
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | QUIT     | Stop execution of the command.                |
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 
/CONTIGUOUS
 /NOCONTIGUOUS 
 Qualifies output-file-spec.
 Specifies that the output file must occupy contiguous physical disk
 blocks. By default, the COPY command creates an output file in the
 same format as the corresponding input file and does not report an
 error if not enough space exists for a contiguous allocation.
/CREATED
 See /BACKUP.
/EXCLUDE=(file-spec,...)
 Omits the specified file(s) from the copy operation. You can include a
 directory but not a device in the file specification(s). Wildcard
 characters are allowed.
/EXPIRED
 See /BACKUP.
/EXTENSION=n
 Qualifies output-file-spec.
 Sets the default extend quantity for the output file.
/LOG
 /NOLOG (default)
 Displays file specifications of input and output files as well as the
 number of blocks or records copied after each copy operation. Displays
 the number of files created after the entire copy operation.
/MODIFIED
 See /BACKUP.
/OVERLAY
 /NOOVERLAY (default)
 Qualifies output-file-spec
 Overlays the existing specified file rather than allocating new space
 for the file.
/PROTECTION=(ownership[:access],...)
 Qualifies output-file-spec.
 Specifies protection for the output file. Specify ownership as SYSTEM,
 OWNER, GROUP, or WORLD and access as R, W, E, or D. The default
 protection is that of the existing output file; if no output file
 exists, the current default protection applies.
/READ_CHECK
 /NOREAD_CHECK (default)
 Qualifies input-file-spec.
 Reads each record in the input file(s) twice to verify that it has
 been read correctly.
/REPLACE
 /NOREPLACE (default)
 Qualifies output-file-spec.
 Deletes (if a version number is specified in the output file) the
 existing file with that specification and creates a new file
 (allocating new space). If no version number is specified in the
 output file specification, a new version of the output file is created
 (regardless of /REPLACE). If an existing version number is specified
 in the output file specification without /REPLACE, an error occurs.
/SINCE[=time]
 Selects for the copy operation only those files dated (creation,
 modification, expiration, or backup) after the specified time. You can
 specify time as an absolute time, a combination of absolute and delta
 times, or as one of the following keywords: TODAY (default), TOMORROW,
 YESTERDAY.
/TRUNCATE
 /NOTRUNCATE (default)
 Qualifies output-file-spec.
 Truncates the output file at end of file during the copy operation. By
 default, the size of the output file is determined by the allocation
 of the input file.
/VOLUME=relative-volume-no

 a multivolume set. By default, the output file is placed arbitrarily
 in a multivolume set.
/WRITE_CHECK
 /NOWRITE_CHECK (default)
 Qualifies output-file-spec.
 Reads each record in the output file(s) after the record is written to
 verify that it is written correctly.

1 CREATE
Creates a sequential text file (or files). Specify the content of the
file(s) on the lines following the command, one record per line. In
interactive mode, terminate the file input with CTRL/Z. In a command
procedure, terminate the file input with a line with a dollar sign in
column one or with the end of the command procedure.
 
Format
 CREATE file-spec,...
2 Parameters
file-spec

 /NOLOG (default)
 Displays the directory specification of each directory created as the
 command executes.
/OWNER_UIC=[uic]
 Requires SYSPRV privilege for a UIC other than your own.
 Specifies an owner UIC for the directory. The default is your UIC. You
 can specify the keyword PARENT in place of a UIC to mean the UIC of
 the parent directory. The default UIC depends upon the format of the
 directory name: (1) if you specify the directory name in either
 alphanumeric or subdirectory format, the default is your UIC; (2) if
 you specify the directory in UIC format, the default is the specified
 UIC.
/PROTECTION=(ownership[:access],...)
 Specifies protection for the directory. Specify ownership as SYSTEM,
 OWNER, GROUP, or WORLD and protection as R, W, E, or D. The default
 protection is the protection of the parent directory (the master
 directory for top-level directories) minus any delete access.
/VERSION_LIMIT=limit
 Specifies the number of versions of any one file that can exist in the
 directory. If you go over the limit, the system deletes the lowest
 numbered version. A specification of 0 means no limit. A maximum limit
 of approximately 60 versions applies no matter the specification. The
 default is the limit for the parent directory.
/VOLUME=relative-volume-no
 Requests that the directory file be placed on the specified relative
 volume number of a multi-volume set. By default, the file is placed
 arbitrarily within the multi-volume set.
2 /NAME_TABLE

 table. The string can include alphanumeric characters, the dollar
 sign, and the underscore.
3 Qualifiers
/ATTRIBUTES[=(keyword,...)]
 Specifies attributes for the table. By default, no attributes are set.
 Possible keywords are:
 
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | CONFINE  | Does not copy the table name or the logical   |
 |          | names contained in the table into a spawned   |
 |          | subprocess; relevant only for process-private |
 |          | tables.                                       |
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | NO_ALIAS | Prohibits creation of table names with the    |
 |          | same name in an outer (less privileged) access|
 |          | mode in the same logical name table directory;|
 |          | deletes any previously created, identical     |
 |          | names in an outer (less privileged) mode in   |
 |          | the same logical name directory.              |
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 | SUPERSEDE| If a name exists within the appropriate       |
 |          | directory at the indicated access mode, it is |
 |          | deleted, and a new table is created.          |
 +----------+-----------------------------------------------+
 
/EXECUTIVE_MODE
 /SUPERVISOR_MODE (default)
 /USER_MODE
 Requires SYSNAM privilege for /EXECUTIVE_MODE.
 Specifies the access mode of the table. If you specify executive mode
 without having SYSNAM privilege, a supervisor mode logical name table
 is created.
/LOG (default)
 /NOLOG
 Specifies whether or not an informational message is generated when
 the SUPERSEDE attribute was specified or when the table already exists
 but the SUPERSEDE attribute was not specified.
/PARENT_TABLE=table
 Requires SYSPRV and ENABLE access to specify a shareable table.
 Specifies the name of the parent table, which must have the same
 access mode or an access mode inner to the access mode of table you
 are creating. Defaults to LNM$PROCESS_DIRECTORY. The parent table
 determines whether the table is private or shareable and where the
 quota of the new table comes from.
/PROTECTION=(ownership[:access],...)
 Applies the specified protection to shareable name tables. The
 ownership categories are SYSTEM, OWNER, GROUP, WORLD; the access
 categories are R (read), W (write), E (enable), and D (delete). The
 default protection is (SYSTEM:RWED,OWNER:RWED,GROUP:,WORLD:)
/QUOTA=number-of-bytes
 Specifies the size limit of the table. The size of each logical name
 entered in the new table is deducted from this size limit. The new
 table's quota is statically withdrawn from the parent table's quota
 holder. The parent table's quota holder is the first logical name
 table encountered when working upward in the table hierarchy that has
 an explicit quota and is therefore its own quota holder. If /QUOTA is
 not specified or the size limit is 0, the parent table's quota holder
 becomes the new table's quota holder and space is dynamically
 withdrawn from it whenever a logical name is entered in this new
 table.
/SUPERVISOR_MODE (default)
 See /EXECUTIVE_MODE.
/USER_MODE
 See /EXECUTIVE_MODE.

1 DEALLOCATE
Makes an allocated device available to other processes (but does not
deassign any logical name associated with the device).
 
Format
 DEALLOCATE [device-name]

job table and the job table itself are deleted when your process
terminates. User mode logical names in the process table are deleted
automatically when the next image exits. All other logical names in
shareable tables remain unless explicitly deassigned. All names in
descendant tables are deleted when the parent table logical name is
deassigned.
 
Format
 DEASSIGN [logical-name[:]]
2 Parameters

/CHANGE_BAR=([change-char][,[NO]NUMBER])
 Marks with the specified character each line in the input1 file that
 differs from the corresponding line in the input2 file. The change bar
 character defaults to an exclamation point (!) for Ascii output. If
 you specify hexadecimal or octal output (see /MODE qualifier), the
 change bar character is ignored and differences are marked by
 a "***CHANGE***" string. The keyword NONUMBER suppresses line
 numbers in the listing. If only one option is specified, the
 parentheses can be omitted.
/COMMENT_DELIMITER[=(character[,...])]
 Ignores lines starting with a specified comment character. If the
 comment character is an exclamation point or semicolon, it can appear
 anywhere in the line and characters to the right of the character are

1 DISCONNECT
Breaks the connection between a physical terminal and a virtual
terminal. After the physical terminal is disconnected, both the
virtual terminal and the process using it remain on the system.
 
Format
 DISCONNECT
2 Qualifiers
/CONTINUE
 /NOCONTINUE (default)
 Permits an interrupted image to continue after the disconnect takes
 place.
1 DISMOUNT
Closes a mounted volume for further processing and deassigns the
logical name associated with the device. If the volume is mounted with
the /SHARE qualifier, its logical name is deassigned but the volume
remains mounted until all processes using it dismount it or terminate.
Note that all open files on the volume must be closed before the
actual dismount can be done.
 
Format
 DISMOUNT device-name[:]
 
 Requires GRPNAM or SYSNAM privilege to dismount group
 or system volumes, respectively.
2 Parameters
device-name[:]
 Name of the device containing the volume -- either a logical name or a
 physical name. If a physical name is specified, the controller
 defaults to A and the unit defaults to 0.
2 Qualifiers
/ABORT
 Requires the VOLPRO privilege if you are not the owner of the volume.
 Specifies that the volume is to be dismounted, regardless of who
 actually mounted it. If the volume was mounted with the /SHARE
 qualifier, /ABORT causes the volume to be dismounted for all users.
/UNIT
 Dismounts only the volume of a volume set on the specified device. By
 default, all volumes in a set are dismounted. (Avoid dismounting the
 root volume of a volume set since it contains the master file
 directory (MFD).)
/UNLOAD (default)
 /NOUNLOAD
 Unloads the device on which the volume is mounted. If you specify
 /NOUNLOAD, the device remains in a ready state.
1 DUMP
Displays the contents of a file or a disk device in decimal,
hexadecimal, or octal format, as well as the ASCII conversion.
 
Format
 DUMP file-spec
 
 Requires the Common Utilities Option.
2 Parameters
file-spec
 Specification of the file or name of the device being dumped.
2 Qualifiers
/ALLOCATED
 Includes in the dump all blocks allocated to the file. (By default,
 the dump does not include blocks following the end-of-file.)
 /ALLOCATED and /RECORDS are mutually exclusive.
/BLOCKS=(START:n,END:n,COUNT:n)
 Dumps the specified blocks. Block numbers are specified as integers
 relative to the beginning of the file. Typically, blocks are numbered
 beginning with 1. If a disk device is mounted /FOREIGN, blocks are
 numbered beginning with 0. START specifies the number of the first
 block to be dumped; the default is the first block. END specifies the
 number of the last block to be dumped; the default is the last block
 or the end-of-file block, depending on the /ALLOCATED qualifier. COUNT
 specifies the number of files to be dumped; provides an alternative to
 END. /BLOCKS and /RECORDS are mutually exclusive.
/BYTE
 Formats the dump in bytes. /BYTE, /LONGWORD, and /WORD are mutually
 exclusive.
/DECIMAL
 Dumps the file in decimal radix. /DECIMAL, /HEXADECIMAL, and /OCTAL
 are mutually exclusive.
/FILE_HEADER
 Dumps each data block that is a valid Files-11 header in Files-11
 header format rather than the selected radix and length.
/FORMATTED (default)
 /UNFORMATTED
 Dumps the file header in Files-11 format; /UNFORMATTED dumps the file
 header in octal format. This qualifier is useful only when /HEADER is
 specified.
/HEADER
 Dumps the file header and access control list. To dump only the file
 header, also specify /BLOCK=(COUNT:0). /HEADER is invalid for devices
 mounted /FOREIGN.
/HEXADECIMAL (default)
 Dumps the file in hexadecimal radix. /DECIMAL, /HEXADECIMAL, and
 /OCTAL are mutually exclusive.
/LONGWORD (default)
 Formats the dump in longwords. /BYTE, /LONGWORD, and /WORD are
 mutually exclusive.
/NUMBER[=n]
 Specifies how byte offsets are assigned to the lines of output. If you
 specify /NUMBER, the byte offsets increase continuously through the
 dump, beginning with n; if you omit /NUMBER, the first byte offset is
 0. By default, the byte offset is reset to 0 at the beginning of each
 block or record.
/OCTAL
 Dumps the file in octal radix. /DECIMAL, /HEXADECIMAL, and /OCTAL are
 mutually exclusive.
/OUTPUT[=file-spec]
 Specifies the output file. The default is the file name of the file
 being dumped and the file type DMP. If this qualifier is not
 specified, the dump goes to SYS$OUTPUT. No wild card characters are
 allowed. /OUTPUT and /PRINTER are mutually exclusive.
/PRINTER
 Queues the dump to SYS$PRINT in a file named with the file name of the
 file being dumped and the file type DMP. If this qualifier is not
 specified, the dump goes to SYS$OUTPUT. No wild card characters are
 allowed. /OUTPUT and /PRINTER are mutually exclusive.
/RECORDS[=START:n,END:n,COUNT:n]
 Dumps the file a record at a time rather than a block at a time.
 Records are number beginning with 1. START specifies the number of the
 first record to be dumped; the default is the first record. END
 specifies the number of the last record to be dumped; the default is
 the last record. COUNT specifies the number of records to be dumped;
 provides an alternative to END. If you specify /RECORDS, you cannot
 specify /ALLOCATED or /BLOCKS.
/WORD
 Formats the dump in words. /BYTE, /LONGWORD, and /WORD are mutually
 exclusive.

 of the input file, you must specify it with the /JOURNAL qualifier.
 The default is /NORECOVER.
2 /ACL
 Invokes the ACL editor.
 
 Format
  EDIT/ACL file-spec
3 Parameters
 file-spec
  Specification of file whose access control list is being edited. The
  file must be a disk file on a Files-11 Structure Level 2 formatted
  volume.
3 Qualifiers
 /ACL
  Indicates invocation of the ACL editor.  This qualifier is required.
 /JOURNAL[=file-spec] (default)
  /NOJOURNAL
  Specifies whether or not the ACL editor keeps a journal file during an
  editing session and the specification of that journal file. File-spec
  defaults to the name of the file being edited and a file type of JOU.
 /KEEP=(option,...)
  Specifies that the ACL editor save the journal file(s) if the editing
  session terminates normally. (If the editing session terminates
  abnormally, the journal files are saved regardless of the /KEEP
  qualifier.) Possible options are:
  
  JOURNAL    Save the journal file for the current session.
  RECOVER    Save the journal file used to restore the access
             control list before beginning the current session.
 /MODE=option
  Specifies whether or not the ACL editor prompts for field values.
  Specify option as PROMPT (default) or NOPROMPT.
 /OBJECT=type
  Specifies the type of object whose ACL is being edited.  Possible types 
  are:
  
  FILE     Specifies that the object is a file (the default).
  DEVICE   Specifies that the object is a device.
 /RECOVER[=file-spec]
  /NORECOVER (default)
  Specifies whether or not a journal file is executed before the editing
  session begins. File-spec defaults to the name of the file being
  edited and a file type of JOU.
2 /FDL
Invokes the FDL (File Definition Language) editor to create 
and/or modify FDL files.  See Section FDL for more 
information on the FDL editor.

Format
 EDIT/FDL file-spec

 Requires the Program Development Tools Option.
3 Parameter
file-spec
 Specification of the FDL file to be created, modified, or 
 optimized; the default file type is FDL.  If the file does not 
 exist, EDIT/FDL displays a message indicating that the file 
 will be created and then creates it.
3 Qualifiers
/ANALYSIS=fdl-file-spec
 Specifies the FDL analysis file (generated by ANALYZE/RMS/FDL) 
 to be used in the optimize script;  the default file type is FDL.
/CREATE
 Creates the FDL file specified as the command parameter.  EDIT/FDL 
 does not attempt to open the specified file before creating it and
 does not issue the message stating that the file will be created.
/DISPLAY=graph
 Specifies the type of graph to be displayed.  Keywords are:

 ADD    Bucket size versus additional record count versus index
        depth
 FILL   Bucket size versus load fill percent versus index depth
 INIT   Bucket size versus initial load record count versus
        index depth
 KEY    Bucket size versus key length versus index depth
 LINE   Default;  bucket size versus index depth
 RECORD Bucket size versus record size versus index depth

/EMPHASIS=tuning-bias
 Allows you to choose either smaller buffers or flatter files.  
 Keywords are:

 FLATTER_FILES    Default.  Generally increases bucket size.  
                  The bucket size controls the number of levels 
                  in the index structure.  If a larger bucket size
                  eliminates one level, you should use this option.  
                  At some point, however, the benefit of having 
                  fewer levels will be offset by the cost of 
                  scanning through the larger buckets.
 SMALLER_BUFFERS Generally decreases the amount of memory you
                 have to use.  Sequential files usually require
                 only two buffers.

/GRANULARITY=n
 Divides an indexed file into a specified number (n) of areas;
 the default is 3 areas.
/NOINTERACTIVE
 Causes EDIT/FDL to execute the optimize script without a terminal 
 dialog.  Requires that you use the /ANALYSIS qualifier to specify 
 an FDL analysis file previously created using the 
 ANALYZE/RMS_FILE/FDL command.
/NUMBER_KEYS
 Specifies the number of keys in your indexed file.  You can 
 define up to 255 keys; the default is 1 key.
/OUTPUT=fdl-file-spec
 Specifies an output file.  The default is the file name of the
 input file with a version number one higher than that of the 
 input file.  The default file type is FDL.
/PROMPTING[=option]
 Specifies the level of prompting to be used during the interactive
 editing session.  Keywords are:

 BRIEF   Lists the possible responses.
 FULL    Default (unless your terminal is hard-copy or operating
         at a speed of less than 2400 baud).  Lists the possible
         responses, each followed by a brief explanation.
/RESPONSES=option
 Selects mode of response to script questions.  Keywords are:

 AUTOMATIC  Where a script question has a default answer, EDIT/FDL
            responds for you using that default.
 MANUAL     Default.  EDIT/FDL allows you to respond to all script
            questions.

/SCRIPT=[script-title]
 /NOSCRIPT (default)
 Selects a script, or sequence of questions, for EDIT/FDL to ask.  
 Script titles are:
 
 ADD_KEY     Model or add to the attributes of a new index.
 DELETE_KEY  Remove attributes from the highest index of your file.
 INDEXED     Create an FDL file that describes an indexed data
             file.  EDIT/FDL supplies values for certain
             attributes.
 OPTIMIZE    Create an FDL file that can be used to tune an
             existing indexed file.  Requires that you use the
             /ANALYSIS qualifier to specify an FDL analysis file
             previously created using the ANALYZE/RMS_FILE/FDL
             command.
 RELATIVE    Create an FDL file that describes a relative data
             file.  EDIT/FDL supplies values for certain
             attributes.
 SEQUENTIAL  Create an FDL file that describes a sequential data
             file.  EDIT/FDL supplies values for certain
             attributes.
 TOUCHUP     Modify the attributes of an existing index.

1 EXAMINE
Displays the specified virtual memory location, maintaining a pointer
at that location.
 
Format
 EXAMINE location[:location]
 
 Requires user mode read and write access to the virtual memory location.
2 Parameters
location
 A virtual address or a range of virtual addresses (where the second
 address is larger than the first). A location can be any valid
 arithmetic expression containing arithmetic or logical operators or
 previously assigned symbols. Radix qualifiers determine the radix in
 which the address is interpreted; hexadecimal is the initial default
 radix. Symbol names are always interpreted in the radix in which they
 were defined. The radix operators %X, %D, or %O can precede the
 location. A hexadecimal value must begin with a number (or be preceded
 by %X).
2 Qualifiers
/ASCII
 Displays the data in ASCII; uses hexadecimal as the default radix for
 numeric literals that are specified on the command line. Binary values
 that do not have ASCII equivalents are displayed as periods.
/BYTE
 /LONGWORD
 /WORD

 default is hexadecimal.
/HEXADECIMAL
 See /DECIMAL.
/LONGWORD
 See /BYTE.
/OCTAL
 See /DECIMAL.
/WORD
 See /BYTE.
1 EXIT
Terminates processing of a command procedure and returns control to
the next higher command level -- either an invoking command procedure
or DCL. The EXIT command also terminates an image normally after
CTRL/Y is typed (executing another image has the same effect).
 
Format
 EXIT [status-code]
2 Parameters
status-code
 Longword (integer) value stating the exit status of the image. (This
 value is assigned to the global symbol $STATUS and the lower three
 bits determine the value of the global symbol $SEVERITY.)
1 Expressions
 The data operations and comparisons are listed below in 
 order of precedence beginning with the highest (operations 
 and comparisons grouped together in the table have the same 
 precedence).

 in all matches being displayed.


Format:
 HELP [@lib-spec] [topic[subtopic]...]
2 Parameters
 lib-spec
  Specification of the help library containing the help information.
  Defaults to the library specified by /LIBRARY (which defaults to

  any  unique  substring of  that  default library's logical name
  translation.
 topic
  Name of the topic. If only a topic name is specified, information
  concerning the topic is displayed along with a list of subtopics at
  the next level. If topic... is specified, information concerning the
  topic and all subtopics is displayed. If topic * is specified,
  information concerning all subtopics is displayed. An asterisk or
  percent sign within a topic name serves as a wildcard. If you type

 parameter specifies the maximum number of blocks that will be accepted
 by the queue for a print job. If a job contains fewer blocks than the
 number specified by the lower parameter or more blocks than the number
 specified by the upper parameter, the job remains pending until the
 block limit for the queue is changed. To specify only the lower
 parameter, you must use two sets of quotation marks ("") in place of
 the upper specifier.
/CHARACTERISTICS=(characteristic,...)
 /NOCHARACTERISTICS (default)

 |                       | file in the job.  The keyword ONE places   |
 |                       | a  burst page before the first printed     |
 |                       | file in the job.                           |
 +-----------------------+--------------------------------------------+
 | [NO]FLAG[=keyword]    | Specifies where to print flag pages        |

 |                       | so on).   The keyword ALL (the default)    |
 |                       | places flag pages before each printed      |
 |                       | file in the job. The keyword ONE places a  |
 |                       | flag page before the first  printed file   |
 |                       | in the job.                                |

 queue (initialized without queue names explicitly specified
 with the /GENERIC qualifier) will be placed in this queue
 for processing.
/FORM=type
 Specifies a form type for print queues. If the form type for a print
 job differs from a form type for the queue, the print job is held
 pending in the queue until the queue form type is changed.
/GENERIC[=(queue-name,...)]
 /NOGENERIC (default)
 Specifies that the queue is generic and that jobs placed in it
 can be moved to a compatible execution queue for processing.  If
 you specify a queue name with /GENERIC, jobs can be moved only to 
 the specified queues; if you do not specify a queue name with 
 /GENERIC, jobs can be moved to any execution queue (initialized
 without the /NOENABLE_GENERIC qualifier) that is the same type
 (batch, printer, terminal, or server) as the generic queue.  By
 default, a generic queue is a print queue.  Use the appropriate
 qualifier (/BATCH, /PROCESSOR, /TERMINAL) to override the 
 default.  (The generic and execution queues must be initialized
 with matching /BATCH and /PROCESSOR qualifiers.)
/JOB_LIMIT=number-of-jobs
 Specifies the number of batch jobs that can be executed concurrently
 from the queue. Defaults to 1.
/LIBRARY=filename (default)
 /NOLIBRARY

1 Instructions
 Invoking the HELP utility
 -------------------------
 The HELP utility displays information about requested VMS topics.  From
 DCL command level (in response to the $ prompt), you can display a list 
 of topics for which help information is available, by typing HELP and
 pressing the RETURN key.  The system responds by displaying a brief 
 description of how to use HELP, followed by a list of topics for which 
 help is available, followed by the prompt "Topic?".  

 You can exit from the HELP facility by typing CTRL/Z (that is, pressing
 the CONTROL and Z keys simultaneously) in response to any prompt.

 Specifying topic names
 ----------------------
 To display information on a particular topic, respond to the prompt
 by typing the name of the topic and pressing the RETURN key.

 If you are not sure of the name of the topic for which you need help, 
 type the name HINTS.

 To display information on all available topics, type an asterisk (*).

 To display all the information on a topic, type the topic name, 
 immediately follwed by an ellipsis (...), e.g., SHOW...

 You  can  specify  percent signs  (%) and  asterisks  (*)  in the 
 keyword as wild card (i.e., match all) characters.  Abbreviations
 result in all matches being displayed.

 Subtopic information
 --------------------
 The information displayed by HELP on a particular topic includes a
 description of the topic and a list of subtopics that further describe
 the topic.  To display subtopic information, type one of the subtopic
 names from the list in response to the "Subtopic?" prompt.

 Special responses to prompts
 ----------------------------
 If you press RETURN in response to the "Subtopic?" prompt instead of 
 typing a subtopic name, the "Topic?" prompt reappears,  enabling you to
 enter another topic name.  If you press RETURN in response to the 
 "Topic?" prompt, you will exit from HELP.

 You can type a question mark (?) in response to any of the prompts to
 to redisplay the most recently requested text and a list of topic or 
 subtopic names.  For example, if you type ? in response to the "Subtopic?" 
 prompt, a list of subtopics is displayed followed by the "Subtopic?"
 prompt.

 specification must be a valid device.  The directory must be a 
 valid directory on that device.  An error in the resulting file 
 specification returns a null string (unless the SYNTAX_ONLY 
 type is specified or a specific field is requested).  Logical 
 names and device names must terminate with a colon.  If you omit 
 arguments, commas to the left of the last specified argument must 
 be included as place holders.
3 file-spec
 A character string containing a file specification.  If file-spec
 is not a full file specification, defaults are taken from (1) your 
 current default directory if def-spec1 is not specified; 
 (2) def-spec1 and then your current default directory if file-spec 
 and def-spec1 are specified; (3) def-spec1, then def-spec2, and

2 F$PID 
 F$PID (context-symbol)

 Returns a process identification (PID) number, and updates
 the context symbol to identify the current position in the
 system's process list.  If context-symbol is equated to zero 
 or a null string (""), returns as a character string the 
 process identification number of the first process on the system.
 If context-symbol was used in a previous F$PID function and has
 not been redefined, F$PID returns the process identification 
 number of the next process on the system.  A null string is 
 returned after the last process on the system has been examined.
 If your system has individual accounts, you may not have access 
 to all processes on the system. 
3 context_symbol

 list of processes.  The first time you use F$PID,
 use a symbol that is undefined or equated to the null string 
 ("").
 
3 Example
 The following command procedure returns the process identification number
 of each process on the system:

  $ NEXT = 0
  $ START:
  $ PID = F$PID (NEXT)
  $ IF PID .EQS. "" THEN EXIT
  $ SHOW SYMBOL PID

 F$PRIVILEGE (priv-list)

 Returns a string containing TRUE or FALSE, depending on whether 
 all of the privileges are set as specified.
3 priv-list
 A character string identifying a privilege or a list of privileges
 separated by commas.
 
3 Example 
 Finds that the current process does not have one SYSPRV, does not have
 WORLD, or does not have either.  To determine which privilege(s) is not
 set, you would have to check each individually. 

  $ PRIVS = F$PRIVILEGE ("SYSPRV,WORLD")
  $ SHOW SYMBOL PRIVS
    PRIVS = "FALSE"
2 F$PROCESS 
 F$PROCESS ()

 Returns as a character string the name of the current process.

3 Example

2 F$SEARCH 
 F$SEARCH (file-spec[,stream-id])

 Returns the full file specification of file-spec. If device or 
 directory are omitted, the current defaults are used.  If version 
 is omitted, the latest version number is used.  If file-spec 
 contains wildcards, each time F$SEARCH is called, the next file 
 specification that agrees with file-spec is returned.  A null string 
 is returned after the last file specification that agrees with 
 file-spec.
3 file-spec
 The file name and type of the file specification to be searched 
 for; wildcards are permitted.
3 stream-id
 A positive integer used to maintain separate search contexts.
 
3 Example

  $ FILE = F$SEARCH ("SYS$SYSTEM:*.EXE")
  $ IF FILE .EQS. "" THEN EXIT
  $ SHOW SYMBOL FILE
  $ GOTO START

2 F$SETPRV 
 F$SETPRV (priv-list)

 If the process has the proper authorization, F$SETPRV enables 
 or disables the specified privileges.  In addition, F$SETPRV 
 returns a string containing the state of the specified privileges 
 before F$SETPRV was executed.
3 priv-list
 A character string defining a privilege or list of privileges 
 separated by commas.
 
3 Example 
 Sets SYSPRV and WORLD.  The current process had SYSPRV, WORLD 
 was set by F$SETPRV.

  $ PRIV = F$SETPRV ("WORLD,SYSPRV")
  $ SHOW SYMBOL PRIV
    PRIV = "NOWORLD,SYSPRV"
2 F$STRING 
 F$STRING (expression)

 Returns the string that is equivalent to the specified expression.
3 expression
 An integer or string expression.  When converting an integer to 
 a string, F$STRING uses decimal notation, omitting leading zeros.  
 If the integer is negative, a minus sign precedes the number.
 
3 Example 
 Evaluates the integer expression and converts it to a character string:

  $ DOG_1 = 12
  $ DOG_2 = 13
  $ TOTAL_DOGS = F$STRING (DOG_1 + DOG_2)
  $ SHOW SYMBOL TOTAL_DOGS
    TOTAL_DOGS = "25"

 F$TRNLNM returns a null string.  If you omit arguments, commas 
 to the left of the last specified argument must be included 
 as place holders.
3 name
 Specify name as a string containing the logical name.  
3 table
 Specify table as a  string containing a logical name whose equivalence
 name(s) are the logical name tables to be searched (the search order is
 determined when the logical name is defined). The table argument defaults
 to LNM$DEFAULT_SEARCH whose equivalence names are process, group, and
 system logical name tables, in that order. 
3 index
 Specify index as the number of the equivalence name to return if the
 logical name has more than one translation;  defaults to 0. 
3 mode

 not abbreviate): USER (default), SUPERVISOR, EXECUTIVE, or KERNEL. 
3 case
 Specify case as a string containing one of the following (do not
 abbreviate): CASE_BLIND (F$TRNLNM searches for a logical name match without
 taking into account character casing;  default) or CASE_SENSITIVE (F$TRNLNM

1 LIBRARY
Creates, modifies, and examines libraries.
 
Format
 LIBRARY library-file-spec [input-file-spec,...]
2 Parameters
library-file-spec
 Specification of the library file. The file type defaults to OLB for
 object and shareable image libraries, MLB for macro libraries, HLB for
 help libraries, and TLB for text libraries. No wildcard characters are
 allowed.
input-file-spec,...
 Specification(s) of file(s) containing modules to be added, inserted,
 or replaced in the library. The file type defaults to OBJ for object
 files, EXE for shareable image files, MAR for macro files, HLP for
 help files, and TXT for text files. Wildcard characters are allowed.
 This parameter is required with /INSERT and /REPLACE, optional with
 /CREATE, and otherwise invalid. You can specify SYS$INPUT to input one
 text module from the terminal: name the module with /MODULE; type the
 text of the module on lines following the command; terminate the
 terminal input with CTRL/Z.
2 Qualifiers
/BEFORE[=time]
 Used with the /LIST qualifier to list only those modules with dates
 (creation, modification, expiration, or backup) that precede the
 specified time. You can specify time as an absolute time or a
 combination of absolute and delta times.
/COMPRESS[=(option,...)]
 Creates a new library file from the current library file, recovering
 any space left by modules deleted from the library. The name of the
 new file is as specified in /OUTPUT or defaults to the next version of
 the current library file. The options are as follows with defaults the
 same as for the current library file:
 
 +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
 | BLOCKS:blocks   | Number of 512-byte blocks allocated to the new   |

 |                 | records  are deleted (only applies if KEEP is    |
 |                 | specified).                                      |
 +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
 | KEEP            | Saves update history records and additional      |

 | MODULES:modules | Maximum number of modules allowed in library.    |
 +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
 
/CREATE[=(option,...)]
 Creates a library file. If input-file-spec is specified (second
 parameter), the modules in the input file are added to the library.
 The options are as follows:
 
 +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
 | BLOCKS:blocks   | Number of blocks allocated to the new library.   |
 |                 | Defaults to 100.                                 |
 +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
 | GLOBALS:symbols | Maximum number of global symbols allowed in an   |
 |                 | object or  shareable image library. Defaults to  |
 |                 | 128.                                             |
 +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
 | HISTORY:records | Maximum number of history records allowed in the |

 +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
 | KEYSIZE:n       | Maximum name length of modules or global         |
 |                 | symbols.  Defaults to 31  for object, and text   |
 |                 | libraries and 15 for help modules.  Maximum      |
 |                 | size  possible is 128.                           |
 +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
 | MODULES:modules | Maximum number of modules allowed in the         |
 |                 | library. Defaults to  512 for an object or       |
 |                 | shareable image library, and 256 for all         |
 |                 | others.                                          |
 +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
 
/CROSS_REFERENCE[=(option,...)]
 Generates a cross-reference listing file for object libraries. Name
 the file with /OUTPUT. The options are as follows:
 
 +---------+------------------------------------------------+
 | ALL     | Equivalent to (MODULE, SYMBOL, VALUE).         |
 +---------+------------------------------------------------+
 | MODULE  | Lists global symbol references and             |
 |         | definitions.                                   |
 +---------+------------------------------------------------+
 | NONE    | Equivalent to not specifying /CROSS_REFERENCE. |
 +---------+------------------------------------------------+
 | SYMBOL  | Lists the symbols by name; the default.        |
 +---------+------------------------------------------------+
 | VALUE   | Lists the symbols by value; the default.       |
 +---------+------------------------------------------------+
 
/DATA=keyword
 Determines whether data is reduced or expanded, depending upon the
 specified keyword.  (Both forms of /DATA perform an implicit /COMPRESS; that
 is, while reducing or expanding the data format, the librarian also
 recovers space that had been occupied by modules deleted from the library.)
 
 +---------+------------------------------------------------+
 | EXPAND  | Expands a reduced library.                     |
 +---------+------------------------------------------------+
 | REDUCE  | Stores data in reduced format, requiring less  |
 |         | disk space but taking  longer to access.       |
 +---------+------------------------------------------------+
 
/DELETE=(module,...)
 Deletes the specified modules from the library. Wildcard characters
 are allowed.
/EXTRACT=(module,...)
 Copies the specified modules into a new file. Wildcard characters are
 allowed. The name of the new file is as specified by /OUTPUT with a
 default file type of OBJ, EXE, MAR, HLP, or TXT, depending on the type
 of library, or is, by default, the name of the library file with the
 default file type.
/FULL
 Gives a full description of each module listed by /LIST. When used with
 /HISTORY/LIST, names the modules inserted or deleted.
/GLOBALS (default)
 /NOGLOBALS
 Includes global symbols of object modules in the global symbol table.
/HELP
 /MACRO
 /OBJECT (default)
 /SHARE
 /TEXT
 Identifies the type of library.
/HISTORY
 Lists history records. Valid only with /LIST. When used with
 /LIST/FULL, additionally lists the names of updated modules.
/INSERT
 Adds the modules in the specified input file to the library. If a
 module being added already exists in the library, the new module is
 not added and an error message is issued.
/LIST[=file-spec]
 /NOLIST (default)
 Writes header information and lists the contents of the library. The
 information is written to the specified file, whose file type defaults
 to LIS. If the file specification is omitted, the information is
 written to SYS$OUTPUT. If specified with other operations (for
 example, /DELETE, /INSERT, or /REPLACE), the listing reflects the
 status of the library after the other operations are performed.
/LOG
 /NOLOG (default)
 Writes a message to SYS$OUTPUT after each operation (for example,
 /DELETE, /INSERT, /REMOVE, or /REPLACE) occurs.
/MACRO
 See /HELP.
/MODULE=module-name
 Qualifies input-file-spec
 Names an incoming text module. This qualifier applies only to /INSERT
 and /REPLACE operations on text libraries. The module name defaults to
 the name of the file. Incompatible with /EXTRACT, /DELETE, and
 /REMOVE.
/NAMES
 /NONAMES (default)
 Lists all the global symbol names and module names in an object module
 library. This qualifier applies only when /LIST is specified.
/OBJECT (default)
 See /HELP.
/ONLY=(module,...)
 Limits a /LIST or /CROSS_REFERENCE operation to the specified modules.
 Wildcards are allowed.
/OUTPUT=[file-spec]
 Specifies the output file specification for a /COMPRESS, /EXTRACT, or
 /CROSS_REFERENCE operation. The file type defaults to OLB, MLB, HLB,
 or TLB for /COMPRESS operations; OBJ, EXE, MAR, HLP, or TXT for
 /EXTRACT operations; or LIS for /CROSS_REFERENCE operations. If
 /OUTPUT is not specified, the default is the name of the library with
 the default file type. Wildcard characters are not allowed.
/REMOVE=(symbol-name,...)
 Deletes the specified global symbol names from the object 
 library. Wildcard  characters are allowed.
/REPLACE (default)
 Adds the modules in the specified input file to the library. If a
 module being added already exists in the library, the new module
 replaces the current module. Replace is the default librarian
 operation.
/SELECTIVE_SEARCH
 Applies only to individual modules in object libraries. When the 
 library is used as input to a link operation, the linker 
 excludes global symbols not referenced by other modules from 
 the resultant image and (if applicable) symbol table.
/SHARE
 See /HELP.
/SINCE[=time]
 Prints only those modules dated (creation, modification, expiration,
 or backup) after the specified time when used with the /LIST command.
 You can specify time as an absolute time or a combination of absolute
 and delta times.
/SQUEEZE (default)
 Compresses (deletes trailing blanks, trailing tabs, and comments)
 macros before putting them in a macro library. Use with /CREATE,
 /INSERT, and /REPLACE.
/TEXT
 See /HELP.
/WIDTH=number-of-characters
 Specifies the screen width for listing global symbol names with
 /NAMES. Defaults to the width of the listing device (usually 80 for
 terminals and 132 for printers). The maximum allowable width is 132.
1 LINK
Produces one executable or shareable image from one or more
object modules and shareable images.

Format
 LINK file-spec,...

2 Parameter
file-spec
 Specification(s) of input file(s) containing object modules,
 libraries, and/or options.  To specify a shareable image as 
 an input file, you must use an options file or a shareable 
 image library.  An object file cannot be qualified by /LIBRARY,
 /INCLUDE, or /OPTIONS. A library file must be qualified by 
 /LIBRARY or /INCLUDE. An options file must be qualified by 
 /OPTIONS.  File types default to OBJ for object files, OLB 
 for object libraries or shareable image libraries, and OPT 
 for options files. Wildcard characters are not permitted.
2 Qualifiers
/BRIEF
 Generates a map containing an object module synopsis, an image 
 synopsis, and LINK run statistics. This qualifier applies only 
 when /MAP is specified, and is incompatible with /FULL and 
 /CROSS_REFERENCE.
/CONTIGUOUS
 /NOCONTIGUOUS (default)
 Allocates contiguous blocks for the image file or reports an error.
/CROSS_REFERENCE
 /NOCROSS_REFERENCE (default)
 Generates a symbols cross-reference section in the map instead of 
 a symbols-by-name section. This qualifier applies only if /MAP is 
 specified and is incompatible with /BRIEF.
/DEBUG[=file-spec]
 /NODEBUG (default)
 Makes global symbols available to the debugger at program run time
 and executes the image under debugger control (unless RUN /NODEBUG 
 is specified).  The /DEBUG qualifier requires /TRACEBACK -- a 
 specification of /NOTRACEBACK is discarded when /DEBUG is specified.
 The optional file specification names a user-supplied debugger module 
 to take the place of the default VAX/VMS Symbolic Debugger.  Note that 
 a user-supplied debugger is linked into the image, while the VAX/VMS 
 Symbolic Debugger does not become part of the image until run time.  
 The file type for the file specification defaults to OBJ.
/EXECUTABLE[=file-spec] (default)
 /NOEXECUTABLE
 Produces an executable image.  The file specification defaults
 to the name of the input file (or the first input file) and a 
 file type of EXE. If this qualifier follows a file, the file
 specification defaults to the name of the preceding file with 
 a file type of EXE.  No wildcards are allowed.  A specification 
 of /SYSTEM in addition to /EXECUTABLE=file-spec produces a system 
 image with the name specified by /EXECUTABLE.  A specification 
 of /NOEXECUTABLE or /EXECUTABLE=NL: causes the link operation to
 take place without producing an executable image;  since some 
 qualifiers are invalid with /NOEXECUTABLE, /EXECUTABLE=NL: is 
 generally preferred.  If you do not specify /EXECUTABLE, /SHAREABLE, 
 or /SYSTEM, a specification of /EXECUTABLE is assumed.
/FULL
 Generates a map containing an object module synopsis, a module 
 relocatable reference synopsis, a program section synopsis, a 
 symbols-by-name section, an image section synopsis, and a 
 symbols-by-value section.  The full map includes information on 
 modules taken from the default object library 
 SYS$LIBRARY:STARLET.OLB and default shareable image library
 SYS$LIBRARY:IMAGELIB.OLB. This qualifier applies only if /MAP is 
 specified and is incompatible with /BRIEF.
/HEADER
 Creates a header for system images (executable and shareable
 images always have headers). This qualifier applies only if 
 /SYSTEM is specified.
/INCLUDE=(module-name,...)
 Indicates that the qualified file is an object or shareable
 image library and that the specified modules are to be 
 included in the image.  If only one module is specified, you 
 can omit the parentheses.  This qualifier does not search the
 library for unresolved references;  to search the library, specify
 the /LIBRARY qualifier.  No wildcards are allowed.  A file 
 specification qualified by /INCLUDE cannot be qualified by any 
 other qualifier except /LIBRARY.
/LIBRARY
 Qualifies file-spec.
 Indicates that the qualified file is an object or shareable 
 image library to be searched for unresolved references. If a 
 reference is resolved, that module is included in the image. 
 No references are resolved for modules specified after the 
 library name on the command line. The linker must begin operating 
 with a module;  therefore, do not specify a library as the first 
 file specification unless you also qualify it with /INCLUDE.
 A file specification qualified by /LIBRARY cannot be qualified by
 any other qualifier except /INCLUDE.
/MAP[=file-spec] (default in batch mode)
 /NOMAP (default in interactive mode)
 Generates a map of the image.  The file specification defaults
 to the name of the input file (or the first input file) and a 
 file type of MAP. If this qualifier follows a file, the file
 specification defaults to the name of the preceding file with 
 a file type of MAP.  If /MAP is specified without /BRIEF, 
 /CROSS_REFERENCE, or /FULL, the map contains an object module 
 synopsis, a program section synopsis, a symbols-by-name section, 
 an image synopsis, and LINK run statistics.
/OPTIONS
 Qualifies file-spec.
 Indicates that the qualified file is a text file containing 
 options.  The default file type is OPT.  A file qualified 
 by /OPTIONS cannot be qualified by any other qualfier.  The 
 options file can contain additional file specifications and/or 
 link options.  The file specifications in the options file may 
 be qualified with the /INCLUDE, /LIBRARY, /SELECTIVE_SEARCH, or 
 /SHAREABLE qualifiers.  (You cannot qualify a file specification
 with /SHAREABLE on the LINK command line.)  An options file 
 cannot contain command qualifiers or the /OPTIONS file qualifier.
 commas are required.  See Section DCL for more information on 
 options.
/P0IMAGE
 Places the entire image, including the user stack and 
 RMS buffers, in P0 address space.
/PROTECT
 Generates a shareable image that is protected from user
 mode and supervisor mode WRITE access (implies that the 
 image can execute privileged change mode instructions
 even when it is linked into a nonprivileged executable image). 
 To protect particular sections of the image, use the PROTECT
 link option (see /OPTIONS qualifier).  The /PROTECT qualifier 
 applies only if /SHAREABLE is specified;  it cannot
 be used with /EXECUTABLE or /SYSTEM.
/SELECTIVE_SEARCH
 Qualifies file-spec.
 Excludes from the image any global symbols defined in the 
 qualified object module but not referenced by preceding object 
 modules.
/SHAREABLE[=file-spec]
 /NOSHAREABLE (default)
 Positional Qualifier.
 Generates a shareable image with the specified name; file type 
 defaults to EXE.  When used as a command qualifier, the file name 
 defaults to the name of the input file (or the first input file).
 When used as a parameter qualifier, the file name defaults to the 
 name of the preceding file. Wildcards are not allowed.  This 
 qualifier is incompatible with /DEBUG, /SYSTEM, and /TRACEBACK, 
 and overrides /EXECUTABLE.  In an options file, /SHAREABLE is 
 a parameter qualifier indicating that the qualified file is a 
 shareable image.  When used in an options file, /SHAREABLE cannot 
 take a value.
/SYMBOL_TABLE[=file-spec]
 /NOSYMBOL_TABLE (default)
 Generates a symbol table file containing the image's global 
 (executable and system images) or universal (shareable images) 
 symbols. The symbol table file is in object module format and can 
 be used with subsequent LINK commands to provide the symbol 
 definitions to other images.  The file specification defaults
 to the name of the input file (or the first input file) and a 
 file type of STB. If this qualifier follows a file, the file
 specification defaults to the name of the preceding file with 
 a file type of STB.  No wildcards are allowed.
/SYSLIB (default)
 /NOSYSLIB
 Searches the default shareable image library 
 SYS$LIBRARY:IMAGELIB.OLB and default object library 
 SYS$LIBRARY:STARLET.OLB in that order for unresolved references 
 (after all input modules and object libraries are searched).  If 
 /NOSYSLIB and /SYSSHR are specified, /SYSSHR is ignored.
/SYSSHR (default)
 /NOSYSSHR
 Searches the default shareable image library 
 SYS$LIBRARY:IMAGELIB.OLB for unresolved references (after all 
 input modules and object libraries are searched). If /SYSLIB and 
 /NOSYSSHR are specified, only SYS$LIBRARY:STARLET.OLB is searched.  
 To search only SYS$LIBRARY:IMAGELIB.OLB, specify /NOSYSLIB and use 
 the /LIBRARY qualifier to search SYS$LIBRARY:IMAGELIB.OLB.
/SYSTEM[=base-address]
 /NOSYSTEM (default)
 Generates a system image with a base address as specified. If 
 /HEADER is specified and the base address is not a page boundary,
 the base address is rounded up to the next highest page boundary.
 Base-address defaults to hexadecimal 80000000. The name of the 
 image is as specified for /EXECUTABLE. This qualifier is 
 incompatible with /DEBUG and /SHAREABLE.
/TRACEBACK (default)
 /NOTRACEBACK
 Enables the debugger and the traceback facility to translate 
 virtual addresses into subroutine names and source line 
 numbers; displays traceback information when an error occurs. 
 /DEBUG overrides /NOTRACEBACK.
/USERLIBRARY[=(level,...)]
 /NOUSERLIBRARY
 Searches the object libraries equated to the logical names 
 LNK$LIBRARY, LNK$LIBRARY_1, LNK$LIBRARY_2, and so on (without 
 a break, up to LNK$LIBRARY_999) for unresolved references, at 
 the following levels:
 
 PROCESS    Process logical names
 GROUP      Group logical names
 SYSTEM     System logical names
 ALL        Equivalent to (PROCESS, GROUP, SYSTEM)
 NONE       Equivalent to /NOUSERLIBRARY

 Omission of this qualifier or specification of /USERLIBRARY 
 without any levels gives a default of ALL.

1 LOGOUT
Terminates a terminal session.
 
Format

Format
 MERGE input1-file-spec,input2-file-spec,... output-file-spec
2 Parameters
input-file-spec,...
 Specification(s) of existing file(s) to be merged. All input files
 must have the same record format and key description, but may have
 different file organizations. Wildcard characters are not allowed. The
 file type defaults to DAT.
output-file-spec
 Specification of the file produced by the merge operation. Wildcards
 characters are not allowed. The file type defaults to the file type of
 the last input file.
2 Qualifiers
/ALLOCATION=file-size
 Qualifies output-file-spec.
 Required only to override relative and indexed-sequential input file
 characteristics. File-size is the number of 512-byte blocks to be
 allocated for the file and must be an integer in the range 1 -
 4294967295.
/BUCKET_SIZE=bucket-size
 Qualifies output-file-spec.
 Required only to override input file characteristics. For relative and
 indexed files, specifies the bucket size in blocks. for input and
 output files of the same organization, the default is the same as the
 bucket-size of the first input file; otherwise, the default is 1.
 Bucket-size must be an integer in the range 1 - 32.
/CHECK_SEQUENCE (default)
 /NOCHECK_SEQUENCE
 Verifies the order of input records.
/COLLATING_SEQUENCE=sequence
 Names the collating sequence for character data. Specify sequence as 
 ASCII (default), EBCDIC, or MULTINATIONAL.  Note that when you
 specify EBCDIC, the characters remain in ASCII representation; only
 the order is changed. The /MULTINATIONAL qualifier specifies the
 collating sequence of the Multinational character set.
/CONTIGUOUS
 Qualifies output-file-spec.
 Required only to override first input file's characteristics.
 Specifies that the allocation of blocks for the output file be
 contiguous. /ALLOCATION must also be specified.

 on the merge process selected: if RECORD or TAG merge is selected, the
 default is the format of the first input file; if ADDRESS or INDEX
 merge is selected, the default is FIXED.
/INDEXED_SEQUENTIAL
 /RELATIVE

 a new output file is created for sequential and relative files. If the
 output file is INDEXED_SEQUENTIAL, /OVERLAY must be specified.
/RELATIVE
 See /INDEXED_SEQUENTIAL.
/SEQUENTIAL
 See /INDEXED_SEQUENTIAL.
/SPECIFICATION=file-spec
 Identifies the specification file to be used in the MERGE operation.  Any
 qualifiers specified in the MERGE command line override the qualifiers 
 in the specification file.  See Appendix DCL of the MicroVMS User's Manual
 for the qualifiers that can be used in a specification file.
/STABLE
 /NOSTABLE (default)
 Maintains the order of records with identical keys; otherwise, the
 order is unpredictable. The /STABLE qualifier is incompatible with the
 /NODUPLICATES qualifier.

1 MESSAGE

Format
 MESSAGE filespec[,...]

 Requires the Program Development Tools Option.
2 Parameter
filespec
 File name of the message source file.  If more than one 
 file is specified the file names may be separated by commas
 or plus signs;  they are compiled into a single object module.
 Wildcards are allowed.  Device and directory default to the 
 current device and directory.  File type defaults to MSG.
2 Qualifiers
/FILE_NAME=filespec
 /NOFILE_NAME (default)
 Specifies that the object module is to contain pointers to 
 the message data in the named shareable image.  (To create 
 the shareable image:  create a message source file, use the 
 MESSAGE command to produce an object module from the source 
 file, then use the LINK/SHAREABLE command to produce a shareable
 image from the object module.  Device and directory for filespec
 default to SYS$MESSAGE.  File type defaults to EXE.  The 
 /FILE_NAME and /TEXT qualifiers are mutually exclusive.
/LIST[=filespec] (default for batch)
 /NOLIST (default for interactive)
 Generates a listing file named filespec with a default file 
 type of LIS.  If /LIST follows the command, filespec defaults 
 to the name of the first source file and a file type of LIS.  If 
 /LIST follows an input file specification, filespec defaults to 
 the name of the input file and a file type of LIS.  Device and 
 directory names for the listing file default to the current 
 device and directory.
/OBJECT[=filespec] (default)
 /NOOBJECT
 Creates an object module.  If you do not specify filespec, the 
 output file is given the name of the first message source
 file and a file type of OBJ.  Device and directory for the 
 output file default to the current device and directory.  File 
 type defaults to OBJ.
/SYMBOLS (default)
 /NOSYMBOLS
 Includes global symbols in the object module.
/TEXT (default)
 /NOTEXT

 is physically mounted.
volume-label
 Label placed on the volume at initialization time. You must specify
 the label unless the volume is mounted with the /FOREIGN, /NOLABEL, or
 /OVERRIDE=IDENTIFICATION qualifier. (You must specify the label 
 in order to specify a logical name.)
logical-name
 A character string of 1 through 255 characters. If the string contains
 blanks, enclose it in quotation marks ("). The logical name defaults
 to DISK$volume-label for disk volumes. (Do not use a logical name that
 matches the file name of an executable image in SYS$SYSTEM.)
2 Qualifiers
/ACCESSED=number-of-directories
 Requires OPER privilege.
 Specifies the approximate number of directories that will be in use
 concurrently on the volume. The value specified with the /ACCESSED
 qualifier (which can be from 0 through 255) overrides the default set
 when the volume was initialized.
/ASSIST (default)
 /NOASSIST
 Allows operator or user intervention if the MOUNT request fails.
 Operator replies are written to SYS$OUTPUT.
 Note:  to use this, you must start the OPCOM process at boot-time
 by specifying the DCL command, @SYS$SYSTEM:STARTUP OPCOM, in the
 site-specific startup command file, SYS$MANAGER:STARTUP.COM.

 |                 | NOEXTENT or  EXTENT=0 disables extent caching.   |
 |                 | Requires OPER privilege.                         |
 +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
 | [NO]FILE_ID[=n] | Enables file identification caching. N must be a |
 |                 | value  greater than 1. Requires OPER privilege.  |
 |                 | NOFILE_ID or FILE_ID=1 disables  file            |
 |                 | identification caching.                          |
 +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
 | LIMIT=n         | Specifies the maximum amount of free space in    |

 +-----------------+--------------------------------------------------+
 | WRITETHROUGH    | Disables writeback caching which only writes the |
 |                 | file headers of  files open for write after the  |
 |                 | files are closed. Thus, WRITETHROUGH writes      |
 |                 | file headers to the disk on every file header    |
 |                 | operation.                                       |

 | IDENTIFICATION      | Allows you to mount a volume without         |
 |                     | specifying the volume-label parameter (as    |
 |                     | long as MOUNT/NOSHARE is in effect).         |
 +---------------------+----------------------------------------------+
 | LOCK                | Does not write-lock the volume when certain  |
 |                     | errors occur during the mount. Requires      |

 |            | ACP image for the specified device type or controller.|
 +------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
 | SAME:device| Uses the same ACP process currently being used by the |
 |            | device specified.                                     |
 +------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
 | file-spec  | Creates a new process to execute the ACP image        |
 |            | specified by the file-spec (for example, a modified or|
 |            | a user-written ACP).  No wildcard characters, node    |
 |            | names, or directory names are allowed in the file     |
 |            | specification.                                        |

1 Protection
 The system provides two levels of protection:  access control lists (ACL)
 and protection masks.  ACLs provide the first level of protection and are
 optional. If no ACL is provided, the object is protected as specified by 
 its protection mask.  

2 ACL
 An ACL consists of one or more access control entries (ACEs).  Each ACE 
 can have one of three formats:

 (ALARM_JOURNAL=name)
     An ALARM_JOURNAL ACE specifies the name of an alarm journal to 
     which security alarms are sent.  Currently, the only name allowed
     is SECURITY.

 (DEFAULT_PROTECTION,ownership[:access],...)
     A DEFAULT_PROTECTION ACE specifies the default protection for a 
     directory.  Specify protection mask as described by the 
     Protection_Mask topic.
   
 (IDENTIFIER=identifier,OPTIONS=option+...,ACCESS=access+...)
     An IDENTIFIER ACE specifies the access allowed to the users 
     specified by identifier.  Possible option keywords are:
       NONE        Same as omitting OPTIONS.
       DEFAULT     Use in directory files only.  Copies the ACE (minus 
                   the DEFAULT option) to subsequently created files in 
                   the directory.
       HIDDEN      The ACE can be changed only by the program that 
                   created it; cannot be specified from DCL command level.
       PROTECTED   Prevents the ACE from being deleted during an attempt 
                   to delete the entire ACL.
       NOPROPAGATE The ACE is not propagated when the ACL is copied from
                   one version of a file to a later version of the file.
     Possible access keywords are:
       NONE     User cannot access the file.
       READ     User can read the file.
       WRITE    User can read from or write to the file.
       EXECUTE  User can execute the file.
       DELETE   User can delete the file.
       CONTROL  User can change the file's protection.
       SUCCESS  Causes an alarm if access is granted to the file.
       FAILURE  Causes an alarm if access is denied to the file.

  For information on identifiers, type identifiers.
3 Identifiers
 An alphanumeric string that identifies one or more users.  One type of 
 identifier is a user identification code (UIC), which can be numeric or
 alphanumeric.  A UIC has the following format (brackets and comma 
 required):  

 [group,member]
 
 A numeric UIC consists of a group number in the range 0 through 37776
 octal and a member number in the range 0 through 177776 octal.  An 
 alphanumeric UIC consists of a member name and, optionally, a group 
 name; both member and group names must contain at least one alphabetic
 character and up to a maximum of 32 alphanumeric characters (including
 A-Z, 0-9, underscore, and dollar sign characters).
2 Protection_Mask
 A protection mask consists of 4 fields each with 4 indicators.
 Each  field  applies  to one category of ownership.  Each indicator
 indicator within a  field applies to one category of access.  The  
 fields  and  indicators  are as follows:

     +--------+----------+  +-----------+------------------+
     | Field  | Ownership|  | Indicator |      Access      |
     +--------+----------+  +-----------+------------------+
     +--------+----------+  +-----------+------------------+
     | SYSTEM | System   |  |     R     | Read (allocate)  |
     +--------+----------+  +-----------+------------------+
     | OWNER  | Owner    |  |     W     | Write            |
     +--------+----------+  +-----------+------------------+
     | GROUP  | Group    |  |     E     | Execute (create) |
     +--------+----------+  +-----------+------------------+
     | WORLD  | World    |  |     D     | Delete           |
     +--------+----------+  +-----------+------------------+

Typically, commands require you to specify protection in the form:

	(field[:indicators],...)

Do not separate indicators.  For example, if system users are allowed full
access to an object and world  users  are  allowed  only  read and execute
access to the object, specify the protection as (SYSTEM:RWED,WORLD:RE). 
Omitted fields default to no access, except in the case of SET PROTECTION
where omitted fields retain the existing protection.

1 RUN
2 Image
Executes an image within the context of your process.
 
Format
 RUN file-spec
3 Parameters
file-spec
 Specification of a file containing an executable image. The file type
 defaults to EXE. Wildcard characters are not allowed.
3 Qualifiers
/DEBUG
 /NODEBUG
 Executes the image under control of the debugger. The default is
 /DEBUG if the image is linked with /DEBUG and /NODEBUG if the image is
 linked without /DEBUG. The /DEBUG qualifier is invalid if the image is
 linked with /NOTRACEBACK. The /NODEBUG qualifier overrides the effect
 of LINK/DEBUG.
2 Process
Creates a subprocess or a detached process to run an image and deletes
the process when the image completes execution.
 
Format
 RUN file-spec (process)
3 Parameters
file-spec
 Specification of a file containing an executable image. The file type
 defaults to EXE. Wildcards are not allowed.
3 Qualifiers
/ACCOUNTING (default)
 /NOACCOUNTING
 Requires the Secure User Environment Option.
 Requires ACNT privilege to disable accounting.
 Logs accounting records for the created process.
/AST_LIMIT=quota
 Specifies the maximum number of asynchronous system traps (ASTs) that
 the created process can have outstanding. The default quota is that
 established at system generation time. The minimum required for any
 process to execute is 2. The AST limit quota is nondeductible.
/AUTHORIZE 
 /NOAUTHORIZE (default)
 Requires DETACH privilege.
 Searches the user authorization file to validate a detached process
 when the image to be executed is the system login image
 (LOGINOUT.EXE). The /NOAUTHORIZE qualifier creates a detached process
 that runs under the control of the command interpreter.
/BUFFER_LIMIT=quota
 Specifies the maximum amount of memory, in bytes, that the process can
 use for buffered I/O operations or temporary mailbox creation. The
 quota default is that established at system generation time. The
 minimum amount required for any process to execute is 1024 bytes; the
 buffer limit quota is pooled.
/DELAY=delta-time
 Places the created process in hibernation and awakens it after a
 specified time interval. If you specify both /DELAY and /INTERVAL, the
 first wakeup request occurs at the time specified by /DELAY and all
 subsequent wakeups occur at intervals as specified by /INTERVAL.
/DETACHED
 /NODETACHED
 Creates a detached process with the same user identification code
 (UIC) as the current process. (Use the /UIC qualifier to create a
 detached process with a different UIC.) By default, the detached
 process has the same resource quotas as the current process; the
 DETACH privilege allows you to specify quotas for the detached
 process. The maximum number of detached processes that you can create
 is limited to the quota defined by MAX_DETACH in your user
 authorization file, unless you have the DETACH privilege.
/DUMP
 /NODUMP (default)
 When an image terminates due to an unhandled error, writes the
 contents of the address space to the file named
 SYS$LOGIN:IMAGEDUMP.DMP
/ENQUEUE_LIMIT=quota
 Specifies the maximum number of locks that a process can have
 outstanding at any one time. The default quota is that established at
 system generation time. The minimum required for any process to
 operate is 2.
/ERROR=file-spec
 Defines an equivalence name string of from 1 to 63 alphanumeric
 characters for the logical device name SYS$ERROR. The logical name and
 equivalence name are placed in the process logical name table for the
 created process. (This qualifier is ignored if you are running
 SYS$SYSTEM:LOGINOUT.)
/EXTENT=quota
 Specifies the maximum size to which the image being executed in the
 process can increase its physical memory size. The default quota is
 that established at system generation time. The minimum value required
 for any process to execute is 10 pages. The extent quota is
 nondeductible.
/FILE_LIMIT=quota
 Specifies the maximum number of files that a process can have open at
 any one time. The default quota is that established at system
 generation time. The minimum amount required for any process to
 execute is 2. The file limit quota is pooled.
/INPUT=file-spec
 Defines an equivalence name string of from 1 to 63 characters for
 SYS$INPUT. The logical name and equivalence name are placed in the
 process logical name table for the created process.
/INTERVAL=delta-time
 Requests that the created process be placed in hibernation and
 awakened at regularly scheduled intervals. If you specify the /DELAY
 or /SCHEDULE qualifier with the /INTERVAL qualifier, the first wakeup
 occurs at the time specified by /DELAY or /SCHEDULE, and all
 subsequent wakeups occur at intervals specified by /INTERVAL. If you
 specify neither /DELAY nor /SCHEDULE with /INTERVAL, the first wakeup
 occurs immediately, by default.
/IO_BUFFERED=quota
 Specifies the maximum number of system-buffered I/O operations that
 the created process can have outstanding at any one time. The default
 quota is that established at system generation time. The minimum
 required for any process to execute is 2. The buffered I/O quota is
 nondeductible.
/IO_DIRECT=quota
 Specifies the maximum number of direct I/O operations that the created
 process can have outstanding at any one time. The default quota is
 that established at system generation time. The minimum required for
 any process to execute is 2. The direct I/O quota is nondeductible.
/JOB_TABLE_QUOTA=quota
 Allows you to specify a quota for a detached process's job-wide
 logical name table.  (Note that the /JOB_TABLE_QUOTA is 
 specified in a RUN command which results in the creation of a 
 subprocess, it will be ignored.
/MAILBOX=unit
 Specifies the unit number of a mailbox to receive a termination
 message when the created process is deleted. (If no mailbox is
 specified, the creating process receives no notification of the
 subprocess's deletion.)
/MAXIMUM_WORKING_SET=quota
 Specifies the maximum size to which the image being executed in the
 process can increase its working set size. The default quota is that
 established at system generation time. the minimum value required for
 any process to execute is 10 pages. The maximum working set quota is
 nondeductible.
/OUTPUT=file-spec
 Defines an equivalence name string of from 1 to 63 characters for the
 logical device name SYS$OUTPUT. Both the equivalence name and the
 logical name are placed in the process logical name table for the
 created process.
/PAGE_FILE=quota
 Specifies the maximum number of pages that can be allocated in the
 paging file for the process. The default quota is that established at
 system generation time. The minimum value required for a process to
 execute is 256 pages. The paging file quota is pooled.
/PRIORITY=n
 Requires ALTPRI privilege to set the priority higher than your base
 priority.
 Specifies the base priority at which the created process will execute.
 The value of n is a decimal number from 0 through 31. The default
 priority is that of the current process.
/PRIVILEGES=(keyword,...)
 Requires SETPRV privilege to specify privileges that you do not have.
 Defines user privileges for the created process. By default, the
 created process has the same privileges as its creator. If you specify
 a version number (or semi-colon) in the file-spec parameter, the
 current process privileges are used, overriding any privileges
 specified with the /PRIVILEGES qualifier. The following table lists
 process privileges:

 Specifies the maximum amount of CPU time (in delta time) to be
 allocated to the created process. The resolution is to 10
 milliseconds. When the time expires, the process is deleted. The
 default limit is that established at system generation time (usually
 infinite). A CPU time limit of 0 specifies that CPU time is not
 restricted. The time limit quota is deductible.
/UIC=uic
 Specifies that the created process be a detached process and assigns
 it a UIC.
/WORKING_SET=default
 Specifies the number of pages in the working set of the created
 process. The default working set size is that established at system

Optionally creates intermediate (BRN) files for input to RUNOFF/CONTENTS 
and RUNOFF/INDEX commands. 

Format
 RUNOFF dsr-file,...

 Requires the Common Utilities Option.
2 Parameters
dsr-file
 Specification of an input DSR file.  Wildcard characters are not 
 allowed.  The file type defaults to RNO; you must specify the file 
 type for RNT and RNX files.  Specify SYS$INPUT to type the input from 
 your terminal or a command procedure; terminate input from the terminal 
 by pressing CTRL/Z.
2 Qualifiers
/BACKSPACE
 Positional qualifier.
 Bolds, overstrikes, and underlines by backspacing to each character 
 after it is printed, if the printer permits. Otherwise, these operations 
 are implemented by performing a carriage return without a line feed 
 after the entire line is printed.
/BOLD[=overstrike] (default)
 /NOBOLD
 Positional qualifier.
 Specifies the number of times characters are overstruck in a bolding 
 operation.  The value must be 0 or a positive integer and defaults 
 to 1.  A specification of /BOLD=0 or /NOBOLD disables all bolding, even 
 if the appropriate flags are recognized and enabled.
/CHANGE_BARS[=character]
 /NOCHANGE_BARS
 Positional qualifier.
 Enables change bars (the .BEGIN BAR and .END BAR commands) starting at 
 the beginning of the DSR file (just as if you had included an .ENABLE 
 BAR command within the DSR file).  The value specifies the character to 
 to be used for the change bar and defaults to a vertical line (|).  You 
 can specify the change bar character as a single printable character 
 or a number preceded by a radix indicator (%D, %O, or %X) to represent 
 the ASCII value of a printable or nonprintable character.  (For example, 
 you can specify /CHANGE_BARS=%D7 to ring the bell on terminal output.)
 A specification of /NOCHANGE_BARS overrides any .ENABLE BAR command 
 in the DSR file.
/DEBUG[=(option,...)]
 /NODEBUG (default)
 Positional qualifier.

 |              | file.                                     |
 +--------------+-------------------------------------------+
 | FILES        | Places .REQUIRE commands in the output    |
 |              | file (as well as the text of the          |
 |              | required file).                           |
 +--------------+-------------------------------------------+
 | INDEX        | Places .INDEX and .ENTRY commands in the  |
 |              | output file. Index flags are represented  |
 |              | by .INDEX commands before the lines on    |
 |              | which the flag occurs.                    |
 +--------------+-------------------------------------------+
 | CONTENTS     | Places .SEND TOC commands in the output   |
 |              | file.                                     |

 If you specify /NOOUTPUT, no output file is produced.
/PAGES="range"
 Positional qualifier.
 Specifies the pages that will be produced from the output file.  
 Defaults to all pages.  Specify range as follows:

   start-page-no:end-page-no,...

 You can specify up to five ranges; you can omit the colon and the end 
 page number on the last range to mean the last page.  You can omit the 
 quotation marks if you specify only one range.  Page numbers must be 
 specified in their default form, not the form specified in a .DISPLAY 
 command.  You can specify just the appendix letter or name to produce 
 an entire appendix.  You can specify just the word INDEX to produce an 
 entire index.
/PAUSE
 /NOPAUSE (default)
 Stops output at the end of each page during processing.  You must press 
 the space bar to continue processing.  Do not use /PAUSE if you name a 
 spooled device as the output file.
/RIGHT[=spaces]
 /NORIGHT (default except for LN01)
 Positional qualifier.
 Shifts the text on each page to the right the specified number of 
 spaces.  This qualifier does not affect the page width.  A specification 
 of /RIGHT means /RIGHT=5.  A specification of /RIGHT=0 means /NORIGHT.
 The defaults (if /RIGHT is not specified) for LN01 files are as follows:
  
 +-----------+------+-------+
 |    Mode   | LN01 | LN01E |
 +-----------+------+-------+
 +-----------+------+-------+
 | Landscape | 9    | 13    |
 +-----------+------+-------+
 | Portrait  | 2    | 2     |
 +-----------+------+-------+
 
/SEPARATE_UNDERLINE[=character]
 Positional qualifier.
 Prints underlines as separate characters on the next line instead of 
 overstriking with underscores on the same line.  The value specifies 
 the character to be used for the underline character and defaults to 
 a hyphen (-).  You can specify the underline character as a single
 printable character or a number preceded by a radix indicator
 (%D, %O, or %X) to represent the ASCII value of a printable or 
 nonprintable character.
/SEQUENCE
 /NOSEQUENCE (default)
 Positional qualifier.
 Precedes the lines in the output file with the line numbers of
 the corresponding lines in the DSR file.  Sequential numbering is used 
 if line numbers were not explicitly specified in the DSR file.
/SIMULATE
 /NOSIMULATE (default)
 Inserts blank lines instead of a form feed to cause an advance to the 
 top of the next page.  Also stops output before the first page is 
 processed; you must press the space bar to continue processing.  Do not 
 specify /SIMULATE if you name a spooled device as the output file.
/UNDERLINE_CHARACTER[=character]
 /NOUNDERLINE_CHARACTER>RUNOFF
 Specifies the character to be used for the underline character.  Defaults 
 to an underscore (_).  You can specify the underline character as a 
 single printable character or a number preceded by a radix indicator 
 (%D, %O, or %X) to represent the ASCII value of a printable or 
 nonprintable character.  A specification of /NOUNDERLINE_CHARACTER 
 overrides any .ENABLE UNDERLINING command in the DSR file.  Incompatible 
 with /SEPARATE_UNDERLINE.
/VARIANT="variant,..."
 Identifies conditional structures in the DSR file.  You must name 
 conditional structures introduced by .IF to process them.  You must 
 name conditional structures introduced by .IFNOT to exclude them.  You 
 must not name conditional structures introduced by .ELSE to process 
 them.  If you specify only one variant, you do not need the quotation 
 marks.

 +---------+----------------------------------------------------------+
 | PASSALL | Does not translate control and nonprintable characters;  |
 |         | the terminal driver does not actually pass 8-bit         |
 |         | characters to the terminal unless SET TERMINAL/PASTHRU   |
 |         | or SET TERMINAL/EIGHT_BIT are already in effect.         |

 includes the file name(s), the number of records, and the number of
 matches for each file searched.
/MATCH=option
 Interprets multiple search strings in one of the following ways:
 
 +---------+----------------------------------------------------------+
 | AND     | A match occurs only if the record contains all the       |
 |         | strings.                                                 |

 /NOOUTPUT
 Specifies an output file. The default is SYS$OUTPUT.
/REMAINING
 /NOREMAINING (default)
 Includes in the output all records from the first matched record to
 the end of the file. This qualifier overrides n2 in /WINDOW, but
 allows /WINDOW=n1.
/WINDOW[=(n1[,n2])]
 /NOWINDOW (default)
 Specifies the number of lines to be displayed with the search string.
 If you specify the /WINDOW qualifier without n1 and n2, two lines
 above the search string, the search string, and the two lines below
 the search string are included in the output. If you specify n1 and
 n2, the /WINDOW qualifier displays n1 lines above the search string,
 the search string, and n2 lines below the search string. If you
 specify /WINDOW with a single number (n1), n1 specifies the number of
 lines to display including the search string: half the lines precede
 the matched search string, and half follow it. (If n is odd, 1 line is
 added to the lines following the matched search string.) If you
 specify /WINDOW=0, the file name of each file containing a match (but
 no records) are included in the output. If you omit the /WINDOW
 qualifier, only the line containing a match is displayed.

 propagates the entire ACL (except for ACEs with the NOPROPAGATE 
 options) so that a particular access protection can be propagated 
 throughout a directory tree.  For all other files, the /DEFAULT 
 qualifier propagates the DEFAULT option ACE(s) in the ACL of the 
 parent directory to the ACL of the specified file(s).  The /DEFAULT 
 qualifier is incompatible with /OBJECT_TYPE=DEVICE.
/DELETE

 Displays the specification of each object whose ACL is modified as the 
 command executes.
/NEW
 Deletes the access control list of the specified object and replaces 
 it with the access control entry specified with the /ACL qualifier.

command table.  Produces an output set of command tables.  See 
Section CDU for more information on the Set Command Utility.
 
Format
  SET COMMAND [file-spec,...]
3 Parameters
file-spec
 Specification of a command language definition file.  The default 
 file type is CLD.  Multiple file specifications and wildcard 
 characters are allowed.  Separate multiple file specifications 
 with commas or plus signs.
3 Qualifiers
/DELETE=(verb-name,...)
 Deletes the specified verb (command) or verb synonym from the 
 command tables.  A command remains in effect until the verb name 
 and all synonyms are deleted.  Cannot be used with /LISTING, 
 /OBJECT, or /REPLACE.
/LISTING[=file-spec]
 /NOLISTING (default)
 Writes to file-spec a list of line numbers, source statements,
 and error messages.  The file type of file-spec defaults to LIS;
 the file name of file-spec defaults to a file in your default 
 directory with the same name as the input CLD file (or the 
 first CLD file).  Can only be used with /OBJECT and /REPLACE.
/OBJECT[=file-spec]
 Produces an object module containing those commands defined
 in the CLD file.  The CLD file must not contain any IMAGE 
 statements.  The file type of file-spec defaults to OBJ; the file 
 name of file-spec defaults to a file in your default directory 
 with the same name as the input CLD file (or the first CLD file).
 Cannot be used with /DELETE, /OUTPUT, /REPLACE, or /TABLE.
/OUTPUT[=file-spec]
 /NOOUTPUT
 Puts the output command tables in file-spec.  The file type of 
 file-spec defaults to EXE.  If file-spec is omitted or /OUTPUT is 
 not specified, your process command tables are updated.  If 
 file-spec is specified, you must also specify /TABLE.  Cannot be 
 used with /OBJECT.
/REPLACE
 Applies the commands in the input CLD file to the input command 
 tables.  Verb names and synonyms are added where they do not 
 already exist; where verb names and synonyms already exist, they 
 are replaced.  Cannot be used with /DELETE or /OBJECT.  The /REPLACE 
 qualifier is assumed if neither /DELETE, /OBJECT, nor /REPLACE is 
 specified.
/TABLE[=file-spec]
 Processes the command table in file-spec.  The file type of 
 file-spec defaults to EXE.  If file-spec is omitted or /TABLE is 
 not specified, your process command tables are used as input.
 Cannot be used with /OBJECT.
2 CONTROL

 you specify a form type different from that of the queue, the job
 remains pending until the queue's form type is set to that of the
 job's specified form type.
/GENERIC[=(queue-name,...)]
 /NOGENERIC (default)
 Specifies that the queue is generic and that jobs placed in it can be
 moved to one of the specified execution queues for processing. The
 specified queue must be compatible. If you do not specify a queue,
 jobs can move to any execution queue (initialized without the printer,

 name. The file must be in SYS$SYSTEM and must have a type of EXE. The
 default print symbiont is named PRTSMB. (Used for a generic queue, the
 /PROCESSOR qualifier specifies that the generic queue can place jobs
 only on queues that have declared themselves as server queues and that
 are executing the specified symbiont image.)
/PROTECTION=(ownership[:access],...)
 Requires OPER privilege.
 Applies the specified protection to the queue. The ownership
 categories are SYSTEM, OWNER, GROUP, and WORLD. The access categories

 file (or the file name specified with the /NAME qualifier) and a file
 type of LOG is created.
/LOWERCASE
 /NOLOWERCASE 
 Prints the job only on a printer that supports lowercase characters.
/NAME=job-name

 specifies the first page to print; it defaults to the first page of
 the job. The upper parameter specifies the last page to print; it
 defaults to the last page of the job. You must specify double
 quotation marks ("") if you omit the upper parameter.
/PARAMETERS=(parameter,...)
 Specifies from 1 to 8 optional parameters to be passed to the job. A
 parameter can consist of 1 through 255 characters. Enclose the
 parameter in quotation marks if it contains spaces, special
 characters, or lowercase characters. For batch jobs, the parameters
 define values to be equated to the symbols named P1 through P8 in each
 command procedure in the job.
/PASSALL
 /NOPASSALL
 Positional.
 As a command qualifier -- Passes all data in the job to the printer
 without interpretation. /PASSALL is equivalent to /NOPRINTALL.
 
 As a parameter qualifier -- Passes all data in the file to the printer
 without interpretation. /PASSALL is equivalent to /NOPRINTALL.
/PRINTER[=queue-name]
 /NOPRINTER

2 RMS_DEFAULT
Defines default values for the multiblock and multibuffer counts used
by VAX-11 RMS for file operations. Defaults are set for sequential,
indexed-sequential, or relative access files on a process-only basis,
unless a system-wide basis is requested. For indexed-sequential files,
SET RMS_DEFAULT defines default prolog level options. For sequential
files, SET RMS_DEFAULT defines default extensions; if your program
does not specify a default extension, the process or system default is
used.
 
Format
 SET RMS_DEFAULT 
3 Qualifiers
/BLOCK_COUNT=count
 Specifies a default multiblock count (from 0 through 127) for file
 operations, where count is the number of blocks to be allocated for
 each I/O buffer.
/BUFFER_COUNT=count
 Specifies a default multibuffer count (from -128 through 127) for file
 operations, where count is the number of buffers to be allocated. A
 positive value indicates that the specified number of buffers must be
 locked in the process's working set for the I/O operation. A negative
 value indicates that the specified number of buffers must be allocated
 but do not have to be locked. If you do not specify the type(s) of
 files (/DISK, /INDEXED, /RELATIVE, /SEQUENTIAL, and /UNIT_RECORD) to
 which the default is to be applied, /SEQUENTIAL is assumed.
/DISK
 Applies the specified defaults to file operations on disks. (The
 /SEQUENTIAL qualifier assumes /DISK.)
/EXTEND_QUANTITY=n
 Specifies the number of blocks (n) to extend a sequential file; the
 value of n can be from 0 to 65535. If you do not specify
 /EXTEND_QUANTITY, VAX-11 RMS calculates its own extend value.
/INDEXED
 Applies the specified defaults to indexed file operations.
/PROLOG=n
 Specifies a default prolog level for ISAM files where n is 0, 2, or 3.
 (A value of 1 is not allowed.) By default, the value of n is 0; if n
 is 0, VAX-11 RMS sets an appropriate prolog level.
/RELATIVE
 Applies the specified defaults to relative file operations.
/SEQUENTIAL (default)
 Applies the specified defaults to sequential file operations.
/SYSTEM
 Indicates that the specified defaults are to be applied to file
 operations by all processes.
 
 Requires the change-mode-to-kernel (CMKRNL) privilege.
/UNIT_RECORD
 Applies the specified defaults to file operations on unit record
 devices.
2 TERMINAL
Sets the characteristics of a terminal. Entering a qualifier changes a
characteristic. Omitting a qualifier leaves the characteristic
unchanged. (The /DEVICE_TYPE qualifier sets the default

Format
 SPAWN [command-string]
2 Parameters
command-string
 A command string of less than 132 characters that is to be executed in
 the context of the created subprocess. When the command completes
 execution, the subprocess terminates and control returns to the parent
 process. If both a command string and the /INPUT qualifier are
 specified, the specified command string executes before additional
 commands are obtained from the /INPUT qualifier.
2 Qualifiers
/CARRIAGE_CONTROL
 /NOCARRIAGE_CONTROL
 Prefixes carriage return/line feed characters to the subprocess's
 prompt string. The default is the parent process's setting.
/CLI=cli-file-spec
 /NOCLI
 Specifies the command language interpreter (CLI) that will be used by
 the subprocess. The default CLI is that defined in SYSUAF. If you
 specify /CLI, context is copied to the subprocess.
/INPUT=file-spec
 Specifies an input file containing one or more DCL commands to be
 executed by the subprocess. File type defaults to COM. Once processing
 of the input file is complete, the subprocess is terminated. If both a
 command string and the /INPUT qualifier are specified, the specified
 command string executes before additional commands are obtained from
 the /INPUT qualifier.  If none is specified, SYS$INPUT is assumed
 (in which case a SPAWN/NOWAIT is aborted if CTRL/Y is typed to
 abort something running in your parent process).
/KEYPAD (default)
 /NOKEYPAD
 Copies keypad key definitions and the current keypad state from the
 parent process.
/LOG (default)
 /NOLOG
 Displays the assigned subprocess name and any messages indicating
 transfer of control between processes.
/LOGICAL_NAMES (default)
 /NOLOGICAL_NAMES
 Copies process logical names and logical name tables (except those
 explicitly marked CONFINE or created in executive or kernel mode) to
 the subprocess.
/NOTIFY
 /NONOTIFY (default)
 Broadcasts a message to your terminal notifying you that your
 subprocess has completed or aborted. Incompatible with the /NOWAIT
 qualifier or the execution of SPAWN from within a non-interactive
 process.
/OUTPUT=file-spec
 Specifies the output file to which the results of the SPAWN operation
 are written. (Do not specify SYS$COMMAND as a file specification with
 the /NOWAIT command; both parent and subprocess output will be
 displayed simultaneously on your terminal.)
/PROCESS=subprocess-name
 Specifies the name of the subprocess to be created. The default
 subprocess name format is: username_n.
/PROMPT[=string]
 Specifies the prompt string for DCL to use in the subprocess. The
 default is the prompt of the parent process. The string must be
 enclosed in quotation marks if it contains spaces, special characters,
 or lowercase characters.
/SYMBOLS (default)
 /NOSYMBOLS
 Passes global and local symbols (except $RESTART, $SEVERITY, and
 $STATUS) to the subprocess.
/TABLE=command=table
 Specifies the name of an alternate command table to be used by the
 subprocess.
/WAIT (default)
 /NOWAIT
 Requires that you wait for the subprocess to terminate before you
 issue another DCL command. The /NOWAIT qualifier allows you to issue
 new commands while the subprocess is running. (Use the /OUTPUT
 qualifier with the /NOWAIT qualifier to avoid displaying both parent
 and subprocess output on the terminal simultaneously.)
1 START
2 /QUEUE
Starts or restarts the specified queue after it has been initialized.
The /TOP_OF_FILE, /BACKWARD or /FORWARD, /SEARCH, and /ALIGN
qualifiers are processed in that order when more than one occurs in a
command line.
 
Format

 Requires the Secure User Environment Option.
 
 Requires OPER privilege or execute access to the queue.
3 Parameters
queue-name
 Name of the queue.
3 Qualifiers
/ALIGN[=(option,...)]
 Prints alignment pages that enable the operator to properly align the
 forms in the printer or terminal. Possible options are:
 
 +---------+------------------------------------------------+

 |         | numbers as 9's; nonalphanumeric characters     |
 |         | are not masked.  The default is not to mask.   |
 +---------+------------------------------------------------+
 | n       | Specifies the number of alignment pages to     |
 |         | print.  The value of n can be from 1 to 20;    |
 |         | the default is 1.                              |
 +---------+------------------------------------------------+
 
/BACKWARD=n
 Restarts a print queue n pages before the current page; n defaults to
 1.
/BASE_PRIORITY=n
 Specifies the base process priority at which jobs are initiated from a
 batch queue. The value of n can be from 0 through 15. By default, jobs
 are initiated at the priority established by DEFPRI at system
 generation (usually 4).
/BATCH
 /NOBATCH (default)
 Specifies that the queue is a batch queue. (The queue must have been
 initialized as a batch queue.)
/BLOCK_LIMIT=([lower,]upper)
 /NOBLOCK_LIMIT (default)
 Restricts the size of print jobs that can be executed on a printer or
 terminal queue. The lower parameter specifies the minimum number of
 blocks that will be accepted by the queue for a print job. The upper
 parameter specifies the maximum number of blocks that will be accepted
 by the queue for a print job. If a job contains fewer blocks than the
 number specified by the lower parameter or more blocks than the number
 specified by the upper parameter, the job remains pending until the
 block limit for the queue is changed. To specify only the lower
 parameter, you must use two sets of quotation marks ("") in place of
 the upper specifier.
/CHARACTERISTICS=(characteristic,...)
 /NOCHARACTERISTICS (default)
 Specifies one or more characteristics for processing jobs on the
 queue. Each time you specify /CHARACTERISTIC, all previously set
 characteristics are erased. A queue must have all the characteristics
 specified for the job or the job remains pending.
/CPUDEFAULT=time
 Specifies the default CPU time limit for batch jobs. Time can be
 specified as delta time, 0, NONE, or INFINITE. Both the value 0 and
 the keyword INFINITE allow unlimited CPU time (subject to the
 restrictions imposed by the /CPUMAXIMUM qualifier or the user
 authorization file); the keyword NONE indicates that no time limit is
 needed.
/CPUMAXIMUM=time
 Specifies the maximum CPU time limit for batch jobs. The /CPUMAXIMUM
 qualifier overrides the time limit specified in the user authorization
 file (UAF). Time can be specified as delta time, 0, NONE, or INFINITE.
 Both the value 0 and the keyword INFINITE allow unlimited CPU time;
 the keyword NONE specifies that no time limit is needed.
/DEFAULT=(keyword,...)
 /NODEFAULT (default)
 Sets defaults for the following PRINT command options:
 
 +-----------------------+--------------------------------------------+
 | [NO]BURST[=keyword]   | Specifies where to print burst pages (flag |

 |                       | individual files in a print job.) The      |
 |                       | keyword ALL (the default) places burst     |
 |                       | pages before each printed file in the      |
 |                       | job. The keyword ONE places a burst page   |
 |                       | before the first printed file in the job.  |

 | [NO]FLAG[=keyword]    | Specifies where to print flag pages        |
 |                       | (containing the job entry number, the      |
 |                       | name of the user submitting the job, and   |
 |                       | so on). The keyword ALL (the default)      |
 |                       | places flag pages before each printed      |
 |                       | file in the job. The keyword ONE places a  |

 |                       | in the job.                                |
 +-----------------------+--------------------------------------------+
 | [NO]TRAILER[=keyword] | Specifies where to print trailer pages.    |
 |                       | The keyword ALL (the default) places       |
 |                       | trailer pages after each printed file in   |
 |                       | the job. The keyword ONE places a trailer  |
 |                       | page after the last printed file in the    |
 |                       | job.                                       |
 +-----------------------+--------------------------------------------+
 
/DISABLE_SWAPPING
 /NODISABLE_SWAPPING (default)
 Controls whether batch jobs executed from a queue can be
 swapped in and out of memory.
/ENABLE_GENERIC (default)
 /NOENABLE_GENERIC
 Determines whether or not the queue will accept files from a
 generic queue of the same type (where the generic queue was 
 initialized without a queue name specified with the /GENERIC
 qualifier).
/FORM=type
 Specifies special print forms (including width, length, or type of
 paper) for the job. If you specify a forms type different from that of
 the queue, the job remains pending until the queue's form type is set
 to that of the job's specified form type.
/FORWARD=n
 Advances the specified number of pages before resuming printing the
 current file.
/GENERIC[=(queue-name,...)]
 /NOGENERIC (default)
 Specifies that the queue is generic and that the jobs placed in it
 can be moved to compatible execution queues for processing.  If you
 specify one or more names with /GENERIC, jobs can be moved only to
 the specified queues.  The target execution queues may be initialized
 with the /NOENABLE_GENERIC qualifier to disable them from accepting
 jobs from the generic queues that do not specify an explicit
 execution queue list.  If you do not specify a queue name with
 /GENERIC, jobs can be moved to any execution queue (with 
 /ENABLE_GENERIC in effect) that is the same type (batch, printer,
 terminal, or server) as the generic queue.

 By default, a generic queue is a print queue.  Use the appropriate
 qualifier (/BATCH, /PROCESSOR, /TERMINAL) to override the default.
 (The generic and execution queues must be initialized with matching
 /BATCH and /PROCESSOR queues.)
/JOB_LIMIT=n
 Specifies the number of batch jobs that can be executed concurrently
 from the queue; the value of n defaults to 1.
/LIBRARY=file-name
 Specifies the file name for the device control library. (The /LIBRARY
 qualifier can be used to specify an alternate device control library
 when used to initialize a symbiont queue.) The default library is
 SYS$LIBRARY:SYSDEVCTL.TLB. You can specify only a file name; the
 library must be in SYS$LIBRARY and the file type must be TLB.
/NEXT
 Restarts the queue with the next job. (By default, the job that was
 executing when the queue stopped resumes if it has not been deleted.)
/ON=[node::][device[:]]
 Specifies the device on which this execution queue is located; the
 default device name is the same as the queue name. For batch queues,
 only the node name can be specified.
/OWNER_UIC=uic
 Requires OPER privilege.
 Specifies a UIC for the queue. The default UIC is [1,4].
/PROCESSOR=(file-name)
 /NOPROCESSOR
 Used for a symbiont queue, specifies a print symbiont image in
 SYS$SYSTEM:file-name.EXE; the default file name is PRTSMB. Used for a
 generic queue, the /PROCESSOR qualifier specifies that the generic
 queue can place jobs only on queues that have declared themselves as
 server queues and that are executing the specified symbiont image.
/PROTECTION=(ownership[:access],...)
 Requires OPER privilege.
 Applies the specified protection to the queue. The ownership
 categories are SYSTEM, OWNER, GROUP, WORLD; the access categories are
 R (read), W (write), E (create), and D (delete). The default
 protection is (SYSTEM:E, OWNER:D, GROUP:R, WORLD:W).
/RETAIN[=keyword]
 /NORETAIN (default)
 Retains jobs in the queue in a completed status after they have
 executed. Possible keywords are:
 
 +---------+------------------------------------------------+
 | ALL     | Retains all jobs in the queue after execution. |
 |         | (default)                                      |
 +---------+------------------------------------------------+
 | ERROR   | Retains in the queue only jobs that complete   |
 |         | unsuccessfully.                                |
 +---------+------------------------------------------------+
 
/SCHEDULE=SIZE (default)
 /SCHEDULE=NOSIZE
 Schedules whether pending jobs in a printer or terminal queue
 are scheduled for printing based on the size of the job.  When
 the default, /SCHEDULE=SIZE, is in effect, shorter jobs will
 print before longer ones.  If you issue this command while
 there are pending jobs in the queue, the effect on future jobs
 is unpredictable. 
/SEARCH="string"
 Resumes printing the current file on the first page containing the
 specified string. The string can be from 1 through 63 characters and
 must be enclosed in quotation marks.
/SEPARATE=(keyword,...)
 /NOSEPARATE (default)
 Specifies the job separation defaults for a printer or terminal queue.
 Possible keywords are:
 
 +-------------------+------------------------------------------------+
 | [NO]BURST         | Prints a burst page (a flag page printed over  |
 |                   | the paper's  perforations for easy             |

 |                   | number, the name  of the user submitting the   |
 |                   | job, and so on) at the beginning of every      |
 |                   | job.                                           |
 +-------------------+------------------------------------------------+
 | [NO]TRAILER       | Prints a trailer page at the end of every job. |
 +-------------------+------------------------------------------------+
 | [NO]RESET=(m,...) | Specifies a job reset sequence for the queue.  |
 |                   | The specified  module(s) from the device       |
 |                   | control library (see /LIBRARY) are used to     |
 |                   | reset  the device each time a job reset        |
 |                   | occurs.                                        |

 qualifier overrides the working set size specified in the user
 authorization file. Possible values of n are a positive integer in the
 range 1 through 65535, 0, or the keyword NONE. A 0 or NONE sets the
 default value to the value specified either in the UAF or by the
 working set quota established for the queue. You cannot request a
 value higher than the default.
/WSEXTENT=n
 Defines a working set extent for the batch job; the /WSEXTENT
 qualifier overrides the working set extent in the user authorization
 file. Possible values of n are a positive integer in the range 1
 through 65535, 0, or the keyword NONE. A 0 or NONE sets the default
 value to the value specified either in the UAF or set for the queue.
 You cannot request a value higher than the default.
/WSQUOTA=n
 Defines a working set page size (working set quota) for the batch job;
 the /WSQUOTA qualifier overrides the value in the user authorization
 file. Possible values of n are a positive integer in the range 1
 through 65535, 0, or the keyword NONE. A 0 or NONE sets the default
 value to the value specified either in the UAF or set for the queue.
 You cannot request a value higher than the default.

resumes execution of jobs in the queue. (The STOP/ABORT command is
equivalent to the STOP/QUEUE/ABORT command.)
 
Format
 STOP/ABORT queue-name[:]
 
 Requires the Secure User Environment Option.
 
 Requires OPER privilege, E (execute) access to the queue, or D (delete)
 access to the current job.
3 Parameters
queue-name
 The name of the queue in which the job is executing.
2 /ENTRY
Stops the specified job currently executing in the specified batch
queue and resumes execution of the next pending job in the queue. The
job number is the number assigned to the job when it is submitted to
the queue. (The STOP/ENTRY command is equivalent to the
STOP/QUEUE/ENTRY command; use the DELETE/ENTRY command to stop an
entry that is queued and pending execution.)
 
Format
 STOP/ENTRY=entry-number queue-name[:]
 
 Requires the Secure User Environment Option.
 
 Requires OPER (operator) privilege, E (execute) access to the queue, or D
 (delete) access to the current job.
3 Parameters
queue-name
 The name of the batch queue in which the job is executing.
2 /QUEUE

the queue are suspended (until the queue is restarted with the
START/QUEUE command) and no new jobs can be initiated. The /REQUEUE
and /RESET qualifiers provide other ways of stopping queues. To stop
individual jobs on the queue, specify the /ABORT, /ENTRY, or /REQUEUE
qualifier.
 
Format
 STOP/QUEUE queue-name
 
 Requires the Secure User Environment Option.
3 Parameters
queue-name
 Name of the queue.
3 Qualifiers
/ABORT
 Aborts the current print job, deleting it from the queue, and resumes
 execution of the jobs in the queue. (STOP/QUEUE/ABORT is equivalent to
 STOP/ABORT.)
/ENTRY=job-number
 Stops the specified job currently executing in a batch queue and
 resumes execution of the jobs in the queue. To delete an entry that is
 queued and pending execution, specify the DELETE/ENTRY command.
 (STOP/QUEUE/ENTRY is equivalent to STOP/ENTRY.) The job number is the
 number assigned to the job when it is submitted to the queue.
/HOLD
 Places the aborted job on hold; must be used in combination with the
 /REQUEUE qualifier. To release the job, use the SET
 QUEUE/ENTRY/RELEASE or SET QUEUE/ENTRY/NOHOLD command; to delete,
 specify DELETE/ENTRY.
/NEXT queue-name

 new jobs can be initiated; the START/QUEUE command will restart the
 queue.
/QUEUE
 Indicates a stop queue operation. This qualifier is required and must
 precede all other qualifiers and parameters.
/PRIORITY=n
 Requires OPER or ALTPRI privilege to raise the priority above
 the value of the MAXQUEPRI parameter.
 Changes the priority of the aborted job. Must be used with the
 /REQUEUE qualifier. The value of n is an integer from 0 to 255 that

/REQUEUE[=queue-name]
 Stops the current job and requeues it for later processing. Print jobs
 that have been checkpointed will resume printing at the checkpoint.
 Batch jobs containing SET RESTART_VALUE commands will run those
 portions of the job that have not successfully completed. When you use
 /REQUEUE with a batch queue, you must also use /ENTRY. If you specify
 a queue name, the current job is transferred to another queue.
/RESET
 Stops the queue without first terminating currently executing jobs.
 The START/QUEUE command restarts the queue. Current jobs that are
 restartable (all print jobs and any batch jobs submitted with the
 /RESTART qualifier) will be requeued for processing. Current jobs that

processing; execution of the next pending job in the queue resumes.
Print jobs that have been checkpointed will resume printing at the
checkpoint. Batch jobs (specify /ENTRY) containing SET RESTART_VALUE
commands will run those portions of the job that have not successfully
completed.
 
Format
 STOP/REQUEUE[=queue-name] queue-name[:]

 which the job is to be requeued. The second, required queue-name
 (queue-name[:]) specifies the name of the queue in which the job is
 executing.
3 Qualifiers
/ENTRY=job-number
 Required with batch queues to specify the job; the job-number is the number
 assigned to the job when it was submitted to the queue.
/HOLD
 Places the aborted job in a hold state for later release with the SET/QUEUE
 /ENTRY/RELEASE or SET QUEUE/ENTRY/NOHOLD command.  (Use DELETE/ENTRY to
 delete a job in the hold state.)
/PRIORITY=n
 Requires either OPER (operator) privilege or ALTPRI (alter priority)
 privilege to raise the priority value above the value of the SYSGEN
 parameter MAXQUEPRI.
 Changes the priority of the requeued job. The value of n can be from 0
 to 255; the default value of n is the job's current priority value.

/SYMBOL
 Causes the expression to be interpreted and its expanded value placed
 in a 2048-byte (instead of a 1024-byte) buffer before the WRITE
 operation is performed. If you specify multiple expressions, their
 values are concatenated and placed in the 2048-byte buffer. Each
 expression specified must be a symbol.
/UPDATE
 Replaces the last record read with the specified data-item. The
 specified data item must be exactly the same size as the record it is
 replacing. This qualifier can only be used if the file is opened for
 both read and write access.
